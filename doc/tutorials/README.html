<h1 id="introduction-to-rivet">Introduction to Rivet</h1>
<p>Rivet is a system for preservation of particle-collider analysis logic, analysis reinterpretation via MC simulations, and the validation and improvement of Monte Carlo event generator codes. It covers all aspects of collider physics, from unfolded precision measurements to reconstruction-level searches, and physics from the Standard Model to BSM theories, and from perturbative jet, boson and top-quarks to hadron decays, inclusive QCD, and Heavy Ion physics.</p>
<p>Rivet is the most widespread way by which analysis code from the LHC and other high-energy collider experiments is preserved for comparison to and development of future theory models. It is used by phenomenologists, MC generator developers, and experimentalists on the LHC and other facilities. Coding analyses in Rivet is a great way to publish executable code that extends the longevity, relevance, and impact of your publications!</p>
<p>These short guides will help you with everything from installation, to first runs of existing analyses, to writing, running, and plotting results, as well as how to implement and contribute your own analyses.</p>
