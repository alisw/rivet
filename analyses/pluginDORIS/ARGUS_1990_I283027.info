Year: 1990
Summary: Anti-deuteron production in $\Upsilon$ decays
Experiment: ARGUS
Collider: DORIS
InspireID: 283027
Status: VALIDATED
Authors:
 - Peter Richardson <peter.richardson@durham.ac.uk>

RunInfo: Upsilon(1S) decays (originally e+e- production)
Description:
  'Measurement of the anti-deuteron spectrum in $\Upsilon(1S)$ decays. The measurement was original an average of
   both $\Upsilon(1S)$ and $\Upsilon(2S)$ decays but the $\Upsilon(2S)$ sample
   is re-scaled to the  $\Upsilon(1S)$.'
ValidationInfo:
  'Herwig 7 events with protons relabelled as did not have anything making deuterons'
