Description: Measurement of inclusive production of charged pions, kaons and protons
 from $\Upsilon(4S)$ decays. Kaon spectra are determined in two different ways using
 particle identification and detecting decays in-flight. 
 Results are background continuum subtracted. This analysis is useful for
 tuning $B$ meson decay modes.
