Description:
  'Ratio of the cross section for the production of $K^0_S$ to that for $\mu^+\mu^-$ between $3.6$ and $31.6$ GeV.
   The average number of $K^0$ per hadronic event is also provided for some energies, together with the kaon spectrum
   at 9.4 and 31.6 GeV. N.B. The point at $9.45\to9.456$ GeV is from the $\Upsilon(1S)$ resonance.'
