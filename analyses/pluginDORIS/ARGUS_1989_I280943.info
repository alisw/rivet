Description:
  'Measurements of the scaled momentum spectrum for $D_1(2420)^0$ and $D^*_2(2460)^0$ production in $e^+e^-$ collisions at 10 GeV.
   The decays $D_1(2420)^0, D^*_2(2460)^0 \to D^{*+}\pi^-\to D^0\pi^+\pi^-$ were used and the helicity angle,
   i.e. the angle between the two pions in the rest frame of the $D^*$ are is measured. '
