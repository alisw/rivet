Description:
  'Measurement of the charged particle  multiplicities and a thrust-like variable
   in $\Upsilon(1S,2S)$ decays and nearby continuum. As LENA had no magnetic field the momenta of the charged particles were not measured and therefore a thrust-like variable $T^\prime$ was constructed using only the directions of the charged particles.'
