Summary: Measurement of Central Exclusive Production of charged hadron pairs h+h- (h=pi,K,p) at sqrt(s)=200 GeV with forward proton tagging in Roman Pots

Description:
  'The differential fiducial cross sections are measured for the process of CEP of h+h- pairs (h=pi,K,p).
  For the details of analysis and definition of the fiducial region see the arXiv.'
ValidationInfo:
  'Tested with Pythia 8.244. Only some small fraction of distributions presented in the paper is reproduced
  in this Rivet routine. However, with the provided code it should be straightforward to self-implement the
  remaining histograms.'
Keywords: [diffraction, exclusive, CEP, forward, DPE, pomeron, glueball]
