Description:
  The paper presents the cross-section and double differential cross-section measurement
  for prompt $K^0_S$ production in pp collisions at $\sqrt{s} = 0.9\;TeV$. The data were taken
  during the LHCb run in December 2009 and cover a transversal momentum range from 0 to 1.6 GeV/c.
  The differential production cross-section is calculated for three rapidity windows
  $2.5 < y < 3.0$, $3.0 < y < 3.5$ and $3.5 < y < 4.0$ as well as the whole rapidity domain
  $2.5 < y < 4.0$.
