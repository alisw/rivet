Description:
  'Measurements are made of forward W and Z production in association with jets in the forward region. 
  Muons and jets are required to have transverse momentum in excess of 20 Gev, and to have a pseudorapidity 
  between 2.0 and 4.5 for muons, and between 2.2 and 4.2 for jets. A single muon is required in the case of 
  $W$ production, and two opposite sign muons with a combined invariant mass of between 60 and 120 GeV are 
  required for $W$ production. The leptons and jets are required to be separated by a radius of 0.5 in ($\eta$, $\phi$) space.'
