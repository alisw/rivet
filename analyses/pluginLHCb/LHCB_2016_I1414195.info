Description:
  'The decays $D_s^{**} \to D^{*+}K^0_S\to D^0\pi^+K^0_S$ are used to measure the helicity angle,
   i.e. the angle between the pion and kaon in the rest frame of the $D^*$. The decays of $D_{s1}(2536)^+$,
   $D^*_{s2}(2573)^+$, $D_{s1}^*(2700)^+$, $D_{sJ}^*(2860)^+$, $D_{sJ}(3040)^+$ were measured, currently the $D_{sJ}(3040)^+$ is not implemented.
  It is unclear if the  $D_{sJ}^*(2860)^+$ is the $D_{s1}^*(2860)^+$, $D_{s3}^*(2860)^+$ or a mixture of the two.
  This histogram is therefore filled we with each state and the admixture.
  The data were extracted from the files supplied on the LHCb website.'
