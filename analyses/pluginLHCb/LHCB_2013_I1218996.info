Description:
  'Measurements of differential production cross-sections with respect to
   transverse momentum, $d \sigma(H_c + \mathrm{c.c.}) / d p_T$, for charm
   hadron species $H_c \in \{ D^0, D^+, D^\ast(2010)^+, D_s^+, \Lambda_c^+ \}$
   in proton--proton collisions at center-of-mass energy
   $\sqrt{s}= 7$ TeV.

   The differential cross-sections are measured in bins of hadron transverse
   momentum ($p_T$) and rapidity ($y$) with respect to the beam axis in the
   region $0 < p_T < 8$ GeV/$c$ and $2.0 < y < 4.5$, where $p_T$ and $y$ are
   measured in the proton--proton CM frame.  In this analysis code, it is
   assumed that the event coordinate system is in the proton--proton CM frame
   with the $z$-axis corresponding to the proton--proton collision axis (as
   usual).

   Contributions of charm hadrons from the decays of $b$-hadrons and other
   particles with comparably large mean lifetimes have been removed in the
   measurement. In this analysis code, this is implemented by counting only
   charm hadrons that do not have an ancestor that contains a $b$ quark.'
