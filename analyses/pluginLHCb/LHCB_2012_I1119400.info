Description:
  'WARNING --- particle map is incomplete for determination of promptness,
   assume unknown particles to have a life time of 0 ---
   Measurement of the production ratios of prompt charged particles (protons,
   pions and kaons). Promptness is defined as originating from the primary
   interaction, either directly, or through the subsequent decay of a
   resonance.'
