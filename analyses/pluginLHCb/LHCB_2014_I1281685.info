  'Proton-proton collisions at $\sqrt(s)=7$ TeV, minimum bias data with a fixed interaction
  rate of 1, no pile-up events. Kinematic cuts are, minimum momentum of 2 GeV/$c$,
  minimum transverse momentum of 0.2 GeV/$c$ and a pseudorapidity range of $2.0 < \eta < 4.8$.'

Description:
  'Measurement of prompt charged particle production in proton-proton collsions at a
   centre-of-mass energy of 7 TeV at the LHC. The measurement is performed in
   the kinematic range $p > 2$ GeV/$c$, $p_\perp > 0.2$ GeV/$c$ and $2.0 < \eta < 4.8$.
   At least one prompt charged particle per event is required. A prompt particle is
   defined as a particle, that either originates directly from the primary vertex or from
   a decay chain in which the sum of mean lifetimes does not exceed 10 ps.

   Charged particle multiplicities are measured in the full kinematic range as
   well as in regions of pseudorapidity and transverse momentum.
   In addition, also mean particle densities are presented as functions of pseudorapidity
   and transverse momentum.'
