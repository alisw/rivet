Description:
  'LHCb measurement of the inelastic interaction cross-section in proton-proton collisions at $\sqrt{s}=13$ TeV. Events are selected if they contain at least one prompt long-lived charged particle with momentum $p > 2$ GeV$/c$ and pseudorapidity ($\eta$) in the range $2 < \eta < 5$. A particle is long-lived if its proper (mean) lifetime is larger than $0.3 \times 10^{-10}$ s, (proper $c\tau > 9$ mm) and it is prompt if it is produced directly in the $pp$ collision or if none of its ancestors is long-lived. This definition is recommended by the LHC Minimum Bias and Underlying Event working group. Prompt long-lived charged hadrons should be used themselves in vetoeing events rather than their charged decay products (e.g. Sigma +/-, Xi and Omega decays are blocked).'
