Description:
  'The energy flow created in $pp$ collisions at 7 TeV within the fiducial
   pseudorapidity range of the LHCb detector ($1.9 < \eta < 4.9$) is measured for
   inclusive minimum bias interactions, hard scattering processes and events with
   enhanced or suppressed diffractive contribution.  Plots for these four event
   classes are shown separately for all and charged only final state particles,
   respectively. The total energy flow is measured by combining the charged energy
   flow and a data-constrained MC estimate of the neutral component. For the two
   highest eta bins the data-constrained measurements of the neutral energy were
   extrapolated from the more central region as the LHCb electromagnetic
   calorimeter has no detection coverage in that phase space domain.'
