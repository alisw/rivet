Description:
  'Measurement of the top pair cross-section in the dilepton channel, where a muon, electron and one $b$-jet are required to be present in the event. A fiducial cross-section is measuremed where the leptons and jets are required to be within the pseudorapidity acceptance of the LHCb acceptance ($2<\eta<4.5$), and to have a transverse momentum greater than 20 GeV.
  Additionally leptons are required to be separated from each other by a radial distance ($\Delta R$) of 0.1, and from the $b$-jet by a distance of 0.5.'
