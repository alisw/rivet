Description:
  'Measurement of $R$, charged particle multiplicites and event shapes in $e^+e^-$ collisions for energies between 12 and 43 GeV.
   The average charged particle multiplicity, thrust and sphericity are measured for a range of energies. The distributions
   are available for 12, 22 and 34 GeV.
   The individual hadronic and muonic cross sections are also outputted to the yoda file
   so that ratio $R$ can be recalcuated if runs are combined.'
