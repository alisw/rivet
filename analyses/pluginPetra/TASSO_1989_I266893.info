Description:
  'Measurement of the $\Lambda^0,\bar{\Lambda}^0$ and $\Xi^-,\bar{\Xi}^-$ spectra at 34.8 and 42.1 GeV by the TASSO experiment at Petra. In addition to the spectra $p_l$, $p_\perp^{\text{in}}$, $p_\perp^{\text{out}}$ and the rapidity of the $\Lambda^0,\bar{\Lambda}^0$ are measured with respect to the sphericity axis.'
