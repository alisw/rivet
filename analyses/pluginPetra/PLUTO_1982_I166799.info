Description:
  'Measurement of $R$ in $e^+e^-$ collisions for energies between 3.6 and 30 GeV.
   The hadronic cross section is also measured in the $\Upsilon$ region, 9.3 to 9.48 GeV.
   The individual hadronic and muonic cross sections are also outputted to the yoda file
   so that ratio $R$ can be recalcuated if runs are combined.'
