Name: MC_ELECTRONS
Summary: Monte Carlo validation observables for electron production

Description:
  Any electrons with $p_\perp > 0.5$ GeV are found and projected onto many different observables.
  There is currently no photon clustering on to these electrons. Multiplicities are tracked for
  both inclusive and prompt-only particles -- maybe a MC_PROMPTELECTRONS analysis is needed?
NeedCrossSection: yes
