Name: MC_MUONS
Summary: Monte Carlo validation observables for muon production
Status: VALIDATED

NumEvents: 10000
Description:
  Any muons with $p_\perp > 0.5$ GeV are found and projected onto many different observables.
  There is currently no photon clustering on to these muons. Multiplicities are tracked for
  both inclusive and prompt-only particles -- maybe a MC_PROMPTMUONS analysis is needed?
NeedCrossSection: yes
