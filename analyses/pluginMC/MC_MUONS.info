Summary: Monte Carlo validation observables for muon production

Description:
  Any muons with $p_\perp > 0.5$ GeV are found and projected onto many different observables.
  To restrict attention to direct/prompt electrons only, use the DIRECT
  option. To use lepton dressing, use the DRESSED option; this only makes sense
  for prompt leptons, and is automatically activated if DIRECT=1 is used, hence
  the main use of DRESSED is to *disable* lepton dressing in DIRECT=1 mode.
ToDo:
 - Add PTMIN and ETAMAX options?
NeedCrossSection: yes
Options:
 - DIRECT=0,1
 - DRESSED=0,1
