Name: MC_PHOTONS
Summary: Monte Carlo validation observables for general photons
Status: VALIDATED
Authors:
 - Steve Lloyd
 - Andy Buckley <andy.buckley@cern.ch>
RunInfo:
  Any event type, but there are many observables for photons associated to
  (semi-)hard leptons.
NumEvents: 10000
PtCuts: [0]
Description:
  Observables for testing general unisolated photon properties, especially those
  associated with charged leptons (e and mu).
NeedCrossSection: no
ToDo:
  - Add a cone size cut on the photon--lepton association.
  - Add FastJet-based clustering of photons on to leptons.
