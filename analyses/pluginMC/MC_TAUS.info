Name: MC_TAUS
Summary: Monte Carlo validation observables for tau production
Status: VALIDATED

NumEvents: 10000
Description:
  Any taus with $p_\perp > 0.5$ GeV are found and projected onto many different observables.
  There is currently no photon clustering on to these taus. Multiplicities are tracked for
  both inclusive and prompt-only particles -- maybe a MC_PROMPTTAUS analysis is needed?
NeedCrossSection: yes
ToDo:
  Include histograms relating to tau decays, e.g. decay product multiplicity, number of
  hadronic vs. leptonic decays, maybe specific tau decays (or put that in a separate
  MC_TAUDECAYS analysis?)
