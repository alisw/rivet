Name: MC_JETTAGS
Summary: Monte Carlo validation analysis for ideal heavy flavour tagging observables
Status: VALIDATED
Authors:
 - Andy Buckley <andy.buckley@cern.ch>
RunInfo:
  Run any events which will produce jets above 20 GeV. Of most interest for processes
  where c and b hadrons can be produced (either hard or soft) of course!
NumEvents: 100000
Description:
  'Plots to study theoretical tagging of heavy flavour hadrons in jets.'
