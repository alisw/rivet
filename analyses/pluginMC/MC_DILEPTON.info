RunInfo: Any event type that produces prompt charged lepton pairs.
NeedCrossSection: no
Description:
  'Finds two charged leptons ($e$ or $\mu$) and plots their basic kinematics
  in the lab frame and in their centre-of-mass frame. Observables of the lepton
  momentum components parallel and perpendicular to the CoM boost direction are
  particularly sensitive to the polarisation state of a decaying vector boson.'
