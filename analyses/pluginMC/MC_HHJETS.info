  $HH$ production with stable Higgses

Description:
  The available observables are the Higgs boson pair invariant mass, the
  separation between the two Higgs bosons, pT of the di-Higgs (any, hardest,
  second hardest), pT and pseudorapidity of Higgs bosons (any, hardest,
  second hardest), pT of jets 1--4, jet multiplicity, $\Delta\eta(h, \text{jet1})$,
  $\Delta R(\text{jet2}, \text{jet3})$, differential jet rates 0->1, 1->2,
  2->3, 3->4, and integrated 0--4 jet rates.
