Description:
   Template analysis for generating calibration histograms to be used
   together with the CentralityProjection and Percentile<>
   classes. The example is pPb collisions at 5 TeV and is based on the
   ATLAS analysis arXiv:1508.00848 [hep-ex]. The reference YODA file
   contains the experimental centrality calibration, but extracted
   from the plot in the paper. Note that this has not been unfolded
   for detector effects.
