Description:
   'The pseudorapidity density of charged particles
    $\mathrm{d}N_\mathrm{ch}/\mathrm{d}\eta$ is measured by the TOTEM experiment
    in $pp$ collisions at $\sqrt{s} = 8$ TeV within the ranges $3.9 < \eta < 4.7$
    and $-6.95 < \eta < -6.9$. Data were collected in a low intensity LHC
    run with collisions occurring at a distance of 11.25\,m from the nominal
    interaction point. The data sample is expected to include 96--97\% of the
    inelastic proton--proton interactions. The measurement reported here
    considers charged particles with $p_T > 0$ MeV/$c$, produced in inelastic
    interactions with at least one charged particle in $-7 < \eta < -6$ or $3.7
    < \eta < 4.8$. The $\mathrm{d}N_\mathrm{ch}/\mathrm{d}\eta$ has been found
    to decrease with $|\eta|$, from $5.11 \pm 0.73$ at $\eta = 3.95$ to $1.81
    \pm 0.56$ at $\eta = -6.925$.'
