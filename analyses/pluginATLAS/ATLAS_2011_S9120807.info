Description:
  'A measurement of the cross section for inclusive isolated photon production at $\sqrt{s} = 7$ TeV.
  The measurement is done in bins of $M_{\gamma\gamma}$, $p_{T\gamma\gamma}$, and $\Delta\phi_{\gamma\gamma}$,
  for isolated photons with $|\eta|<2.37$ and $E_T^\gamma>16$~GeV.
  The measurement uses 37 pb$^{-1}$ of integrated luminosity collected with
  the ATLAS detector.'
