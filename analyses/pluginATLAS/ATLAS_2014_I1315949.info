Description:
  Charged-particle distributions sensitive to the properties of the underlying event are measured for an 
  inclusive sample of events containing a $Z$-boson, decaying to an electron or muon pair. The measurement
  is based on data collected using the ATLAS detector at the LHC in proton--proton collisions at a 
  centre-of-mass energy of 7 TeV with an integrated luminosity of 4.6 fb$^{-1}$. Distributions of 
  the charged particle multiplicity and of the charged particle transverse momentum are measured in regions
  of azimuthal angle defined with respect to the $Z$-boson direction.
