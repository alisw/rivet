Description:
  'Using inelastic proton-proton interactions at $\sqrt{s}$ = 900 GeV and
   7 TeV, recorded by the ATLAS detector at the LHC, measurements have
   been made of the correlations between forward and backward
   charged-particle multiplicities and, for the first time, between
   forward and backward charged-particle summed transverse momentum. In
   addition, jet-like structure in the events is studied by means of
   azimuthal distributions of charged particles relative to the charged
   particle with highest transverse momentum in a selected kinematic
   region of the event.'

ToDo:
 - add 2D plot of forward-backward correlation (as a set of 1D plots)
