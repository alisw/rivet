Description:
  'Inclusive four-jet events produced in $pp$ collisions at a centre-of-mass energy of $\sqrt{s} = 7$ TeV have been
  analysed for the presence of hard double-parton scattering using data corresponding to an integrated luminosity of
  $(37.3 \pm 1.3)$ $\mathrm{pb}^{-1}$, collected with the ATLAS detector at the LHC. The distributions of observables
  sensitive to the contribution of hard double-parton scattering are provided for events containing at least four jets
  with $p_{\mathrm{T}} \geq 20$ GeV and $\eta \leq 4.4$, and at least one of which has $p_{\text{T}} \geq 42.5$ GeV.'
