Description:
  'Distributions sensitive to the underlying event are studied in events containing
   one or more charged particles. Jets are reconstructed using the anti-$k_t$ algorithm
   with radius parameter $R$ varying between 0.2 and 1.0. Distributions of the
   charged-particle multiplicity, the scalar sum of the transverse momentum of charged
   particles, and the average charged-particle pT are measured as functions of
   $\pT^\text{jet}$ in regions transverse to and opposite the leading jet for
   $4 \GeV < \pT^\text{jet} < 100 \GeV$. In addition, the $R$-dependence of the mean
   values of these observables is studied.'
