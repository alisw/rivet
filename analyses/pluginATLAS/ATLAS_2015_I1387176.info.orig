Description:
  High transverse momentum jets produced in $pp$ collisions at a centre-of-mass energy of 7 TeV are used to measure the transverse
  energy--energy correlation function and its associated azimuthal asymmetry. The data were recorded with the ATLAS detector at the LHC
  in the year 2011 and correspond to an integrated luminosity of $158\,\text{pb}^{-1}$. The selection criteria demand the average 
  transverse  momentum of the two leading jets in an event to be larger than 250 GeV. The data are unfolded to the particle level.
  NB--If the routine is to be run on several samples (with different cross sections), the asymmetry has to be calculated again in a
  post-processing step using the merged output file.
