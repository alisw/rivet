Description:
  Measurements of cross sections for the production of a $W$ boson in association with jets in proton-proton collisions at
  $\sqrt{s} = 7$~TeV with the ATLAS experiment at the Large Hadron Collider. With an integrated luminosity of 4.6~$\text{fb}^{-1}$,
  this data set allows for an exploration of a large kinematic range, including jet production up to a transverse momentum of 1~TeV 
  and multiplicities up to seven associated jets. The production cross sections for W bosons are measured in both the electron and 
  muon decay channels. Differential cross sections for many observables are also presented including measurements of the jet 
  observables such as the rapidities and the transverse momenta as well as measurements of event observables such as the scalar sums 
  of the transverse momenta  of the jets. The default routine assumes both muon and electron decay channel of the $W$ boson are being 
  generate and the average will be constructed. Individual lepton channels can be specified using options LMODE=EL and LMODE:MU
  respectively.
