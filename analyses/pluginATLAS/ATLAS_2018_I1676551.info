Description:
  'A search for electroweak production of supersymmetric particles in two-lepton and three-lepton
  final states using recursive jigsaw reconstruction, a technique that assigns reconstructed objects
  to the most probable hemispheres of the decay trees, allowing one to construct tailored kinematic
  variables to separate the signal and background. The search uses data collected in 2015 and 2016
  by the ATLAS experiment in $\sqrt{s}=13$~TeV proton-proton collisions at the CERN Large Hadron
  Collider corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 36.1/fb. Chargino-neutralino pair production,
  with decays via W/Z bosons, is studied in final states involving leptons and jets and missing
  transverse momentum for scenarios with large and intermediate mass splittings between the parent
  particle and lightest supersymmetric particle, as well as for the scenario where this mass splitting
  is close to the mass of the $Z$ boson. The latter case is challenging since the vector bosons are
  produced with kinematic properties that are similar to those in Standard Model processes. Results
  are found to be compatible with the Standard Model expectations in the signal regions targeting
  large and intermediate mass splittings, and chargino-neutralino masses up to 600~GeV are excluded
  at 95% confidence level for a massless lightest supersymmetric particle. Excesses of data above
  the expected background are found in the signal regions targeting low mass splittings, and the
  largest local excess amounts to 3.0 standard deviations.'

  'Cut-flows reproduced to ~20 percent accuracy. Modelling effects and reproduction difficulties
  in the ISR region, matching the experience for the equivalent Gambit analysis using RestFrames.'
