Description:
 'Inclusive jet and dijet cross-sections are measured in proton-proton collisions at a centre-of-mass energy of 13 TeV. The
 measurement uses a dataset with an integrated luminosity of 3.2 fb$^{-1}$ recorded in 2015 with the ATLAS detector at the 
 Large Hadron Collider. Jets are identified using the anti-$k_\text{t}$ algorithm with a radius parameter value of $R = 0.4$.
 The inclusive jet cross-sections are measured double-differentially as a function of the jet transverse momentum, covering 
 the range from 100 GeV to 3.5 TeV, and the absolute jet rapidity up to $|y| = 3$. The double-differential dijet production 
 cross-sections are presented as a function of the dijet mass, covering the range from 300 GeV to 9 TeV, and the half absolute 
 rapidity separation between the two leading jets within $|y| < 3$, $y^\ast$, up to $y^\ast = 3$. Next-to-leading-order, and 
 next-to-next-to-leading-order for the inclusive jet measurement, perturbative QCD calculations corrected for non-perturbative 
 and electroweak effects are compared to the measured cross-sections.'
