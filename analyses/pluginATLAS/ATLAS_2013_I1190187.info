Description:
  'Measurement of the fiducial cross section for $W^+ W^-$ production in proton proton
   collisions at a centre-of mass energy of 7 TeV, is presented, using data corresponding
   to an integrated luminosity of 4.6/fb collected by the ATLAS experiment at the Large
   Hadron Collider. The cross section is measured in the leptonic decay channels, using
   electron+MET and muon+MET $W$ decays. $W \to \tau$ processes with the tau decaying
   into electron + MET or muon + MET are also included in the measurement. The fiducial
   region contains dressed leptons in restricted $p_T$ and $\eta$ ranges. The selection
   has specific requirements for each production channel. A measurement of the normalized
   fiducial cross section as a function of the leading lepton transverse momentum is also presented.'
