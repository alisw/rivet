Description:
  'Measurements of the production of jets of particles in association with a $Z$
   boson in $pp$ collisions at $\sqrt{s}$ = 7 TeV are presented, using data corresponding
   to an integrated luminosity of 4.6/fb collected by the ATLAS experiment at
   the Large Hadron Collider. Inclusive and differential jet cross sections in $Z$
   events, with Z decaying into electron or muon pairs, are measured for jets with
   transverse momentum $p_T > 30$ GeV and rapidity $|y| < 4.4$.
   This Rivet module implements the event selection for the weighted combination
   of both decay channels to produce the average cross section for a single lepton flavour, 
   and uses the data from that combination (as in the paper plots). In the default mode this is how it will run, 
   assuming mixed electronic and muonic events. 
   If LMODE is set to EL (MU), the plots for the individual decay channels (with a slightly
   different fiducial phase space) are made.'
