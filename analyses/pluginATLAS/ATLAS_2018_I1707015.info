Description:
  'Differential cross-sections for the production of a top-quark pair in association with a photon are
  measured with proton-proton collision data corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 36.1 fb^-1,
  collected by the ATLAS detector at the LHC in 2015 and 2016 at a centre-of-mass energy of 13 TeV. The
  measurements are performed in single-lepton and dilepton final states in a fiducial volume. Events
  with exactly one photon, one or two leptons, a channel-dependent minimum number of jets, and at least
  one b-jet are selected. Neural network algorithms are used to separate the signal from the
  backgrounds. The differential cross-sections are measured as a function of photon transverse
  momentum, photon absolute pseudorapidity, and angular distance between the photon and its closest
  lepton in both channels, as well asazimuthal opening angle and absolute pseudorapidity difference
  between the two leptons in the dilepton channel.'
