Description:
  'Measurements of the top-antitop quark pair production charge asymmetry in the dilepton channel are presented using data
  corresponding to an integrated luminosity of $20.3\;\text{fb}^{-1}$ from $pp$ collisions at a center-of-mass energy of
  $\sqrt{s} = 8$ TeV collected with the ATLAS detector at the Large Hadron Collider at CERN. Inclusive and differential
  measurements as a function of the invariant mass, transverse momentum, and longitudinal boost of the $t\bar{t}$ system are
  performed both in the full phase space and in a fiducial phase space closely matching the detector acceptance (at least
  2 leptons and 2 jets with $p_\text{T} > 25$ GeV and $|\eta| < 2.5$). Two observables are studied: $A_C^{\ell\ell}$ based
  on the selected leptons and $A_C^{t\bar{t}}$ based on the reconstructed $t\bar{t}$ final state. The unfolded distributions
  of $\Delta|\eta| = |\eta|_{\ell^+} - |\eta|_{\ell^-}$ and $\Delta|y| = |y|_\text{top} - |y|_\text{antitop}$ are provided.
  USERS SHOULD NOTE THAT EXPLICIT RECONSTRUCTION OF INDIVIDUAL STANDARD MODEL NEUTRINOS IS USED IN THIS ANALYSIS ROUTINE
  TO MATCH THE MONTE-CARLO-BASED CORRECTION TO THE FIDUCIAL REGION APPLIED IN THE PAPER.'
