Description:
  'Measurement of the ordering of charged hadrons in the azimuthal angle relative
   to the beam axis at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). A spectral analysis of
   correlations between longitudinal and transverse components of the momentum of
   the charged hadrons is performed. Data were recorded with the ATLAS detector at
   centre-of-mass energies of $\sqrt{s} = 900\;\GeV$ and $\sqrt{s} = 7\;\TeV$.
   The correlations measured in a phase space region dominated by low-$\pT$ particles
   are not well described by conventional models of hadron production. The measured
   spectra show features consistent with the fragmentation of a QCD string
   represented by a helix-like ordered gluon chain.'
