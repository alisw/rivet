Description:
  'One lepton search for supersymmmetric particles by ATLAS at 8 TeV with $5.8\,\text{fb}^{-1}$ integrated luminosity.
  Event counts in the signal regions are implemented as one-bin histograms.
  Histograms for effective mass are implemented for the two
  signal hard lepton signal regions and the ratio of missing transverse energy
  to effective mass for the soft lepton region.'
