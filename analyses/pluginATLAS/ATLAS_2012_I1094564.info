Description:
  'In this analysis, the assumption that the internal substructure of
   jets generated by QCD radiation is well understood is tested on an
   inclusive sample of jets recorded with the ATLAS detector in 2010,
   which corresponds to 35 $pb^{-1}$ of $pp$ collisions delivered by the LHC at 
   $\sqrt{s} = 7$ TeV.  Jet invariant mass, $k_{t}$ splitting scales and
   $N$-subjettiness variables are presented for anti-$k_{t}$ $R = 1.0$ jets and
   Cambridge-Aachen $R = 1.2$ jets. Jet invariant-mass spectra for
   Cambridge-Aachen $R = 1.2$ jets after a splitting and filtering
   procedure are also presented.'
