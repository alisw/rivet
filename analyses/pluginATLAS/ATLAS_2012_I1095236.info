Description:
  'Search for supersymmmetric particles by ATLAS at 7 TeV in events with b-jets,
  large missing
  energy, and zero or one leptons.
  Event counts in six zero lepton and two one lepton signal regions are implemented
  as one-bin histograms.
  Histograms for missing transverse energy, and effective mass are also
  implemented for some signal regions.'
