Description:
   'Calibration analysis for ATLAS pPb centrality. The centrality measure
   is $\sum E_\perp$ in the lead direction. The reference YODA file
   contains the experimental centrality calibration, but extracted
   from the plot in the paper. Note that this has not been unfolded
   for detector effects.'
