Description: 'Measurements of four-lepton differential and integrated fiducial cross-sections
 in events with two same-flavour, opposite-charge electron or muon pairs are presented.
 The data correspond to 139~fb$^{-1}$ of $\sqrt{s}=13$~TeV proton-proton collisions, collected by the 
 ATLAS detector during Run~2 of the Large Hadron Collider (2015--2018). 
 The final state has contributions from a number of interesting Standard Model processes that dominate in different
 four-lepton invariant mass regions, including single $Z$ boson production,
 Higgs boson production and on-shell $ZZ$ production, with a complex mix of
 interference terms, and possible contributions from
 physics beyond the Standard Model. The differential cross-sections include  the four-lepton invariant mass
 inclusively, in slices of other kinematic variables, and in different lepton flavour categories. Also
 measured are dilepton invariant masses, transverse momenta, and angular correlation
 variables, in four regions of four-lepton invariant mass, each
 dominated by different processes. The measurements are corrected for detector effects and are compared
 with state-of-the-art Standard Model calculations, which are found to
 be consistent with the data. The $Z\to 4\ell$ branching fraction is
 extracted, giving a value of $\left(4.41 \pm 0.30\right) \times 10^{-6}$.
 Constraints on effective field theory parameters and a model based on
 a spontaneously broken $B-L$ gauge symmetry are also evaluated.
 Further reinterpretations can be performed with the provided information.'
