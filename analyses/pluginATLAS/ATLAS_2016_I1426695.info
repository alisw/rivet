Description:
    This paper presents measurements of distributions of charged particles which are produced in proton-proton collisions at a
    centre-of-mass energy of $\sqrt{s} = 8$ TeV and recorded by the ATLAS detector at the LHC. A special dataset recorded in 2012 
    with a small number of interactions per beam crossing (below 0.004) and corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 
    160 $\mu\text{b}^{-1}$ was used. A minimum-bias trigger was utilised to select a data sample of more than 9 million collision 
    events. The multiplicity, pseudorapidity, and transverse momentum distributions of charged particles are shown in different 
    regions of kinematics and charged-particle multiplicity, including measurements of final states at high multiplicity. The results are
    corrected for detector effects and are compared to the predictions of various Monte Carlo event generator models which simulate
    the full hadronic final state.
