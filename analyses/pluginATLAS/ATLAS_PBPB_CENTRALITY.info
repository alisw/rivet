Description:
   'Calibration analysis for ATLAS Pb--Pb centrality. The centrality measure
   is $\sum E_\perp$ in the forward and backward directions.
   The reference YODA file contains the experimental 
   centrality calibration, but extracted from the plot in the paper.
   Analysis can be run for all energies to provide generator calibration
   curves, but only holds data for 2.76 TeV/nn.
   Note that this has not been unfolded for detector effects.'
