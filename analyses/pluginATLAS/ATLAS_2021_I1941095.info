Description: 
    'A measurement of the energy asymmetry in jet-associated top-quark pair production is presented using 
    139 fb$^{-1}$ of data collected by the ATLAS detector at the Large Hadron Collider during $pp$ collisions at 
    $\sqrt{s}=13$ TeV. The observable measures the different probability of top and antitop quarks to have the higher 
    energy as a function of the jet scattering angle with respect to the beam axis. The energy asymmetry is measured 
    in the semileptonic $t\bar{t}$ decay channel, and the hadronically decaying top quark must have transverse momentum 
    above 350 GeV. The results are corrected for detector effects to particle level in three bins of the scattering angle 
    of the associated jet. The measurement agrees with the SM prediction at next-to-leading-order accuracy in quantum
    chromodynamics in all three bins. In the bin with the largest expected asymmetry, where the jet is emitted perpendicular 
    to the beam, the energy asymmetry is measured to be $-0.043\pm0.020$, in agreement with the SM prediction of 
    $-0.037\pm0.003$. Interpreting this result in the framework of the Standard Model effective field theory (SMEFT), 
    it is shown that the energy asymmetry is sensitive to the top-quark chirality in four-quark operators and is therefore 
    a valuable new observable in global SMEFT fits.'
