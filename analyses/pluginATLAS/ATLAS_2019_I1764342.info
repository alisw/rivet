Description:
'The production of a prompt photon in association with a Z boson is studied in proton-proton collisions at a 
centre-of-mass energy $\sqrt{s}=$13 TeV. The analysis uses a data sample with an integrated luminosity of 
139 fb$^{-1}$ collected by the ATLAS detector at the LHC from 2015 to 2018. 
The production cross-section for the process $pp \rightarrow \ell^+ \ell^- + \gamma + X$ ($\ell=e,\mu$) 
is measured within a fiducial phase-space region defined by kinematic requirements on the photon and 
the leptons, and by isolation requirements on the photon. 
An experimental precision of $2.9\%$ is achieved for the fiducial cross-section. 
Differential cross-sections are measured as a function of each of 
six kinematic variables characterising the $\ell^+\ell^-\gamma$ system. 
The data are compared with theoretical predictions based on next-to-leading-order and 
next-to-next-to-leading-order perturbative QCD calculations. 
The impact of next-to-leading-order electroweak corrections is also considered.'
