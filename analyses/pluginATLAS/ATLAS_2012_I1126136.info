Description:
  'Search for direct pair production of supersymmetric top squarks, assuming the stop_1 decays
   into a top quark and the lightest supersymmetric particle, and that both top quarks decay
   to purely hadronic final states. This search has an integrated luminosity
   of 4.7 fb$^{-1}$ at $\sqrt{s} = 8$\,TeV.'
Keywords: [search, bsm, tquark, met]
