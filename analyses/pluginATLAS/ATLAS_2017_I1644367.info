Description: 
  'A measurement of the production of three isolated photons in proton-proton collisions at a centre-of-mass energy $\sqrt{s} = 8$ TeV
  is reported. The results are based on an integrated luminosity of 20.2 fb${}^{-1}$ collected with the ATLAS detector at the LHC. The
  differential cross sections are measured as functions of the transverse energy of each photon, the difference in azimuthal angle
  and in pseudorapidity between pairs of photons, the invariant mass of pairs of photons, and the invariant mass of the triphoton
  system. A measurement of the inclusive fiducial cross section is also reported. Next-to-leading-order perturbative QCD predictions
  are compared to the cross-section measurements. The predictions underestimate the measurement of the inclusive fiducial cross
  section and the differential measurements at low photon transverse energies and invariant masses. They provide adequate
  descriptions of the measurements at high values of the photon transverse energies, invariant mass of pairs of photons, and
  invariant mass of the triphoton system.'
