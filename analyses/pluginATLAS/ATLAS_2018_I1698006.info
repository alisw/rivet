Description:
  'The production of Z bosons in association with a high-energy photon (Z$\gamma$ production) is studied in the neutrino decay channel of the Z boson using pp collisions at $\sqrt s$ = 13 TeV. The analysis uses a data sample with an integrated luminosity of 36.1 fbâˆ’1 collected by the ATLAS detector at the LHC in 2015 and 2016. Candidate Z$\gamma$ events with invisible decays of the Z boson are selected by requiring significant transverse momentum (pT) of the dineutrino system in conjunction with a single isolated photon with large
transverse energy (ET). The rate of Z$\gamma$ production is measured as a function of photon ET, dineutrino system pT and jet multiplicity. Evidence of anomalous triple gauge-boson couplings is sought in Z$\gamma$ production with photo ET greater than 600 GeV. No excess is observed relative to the Standard Model expectation, and upper limits are set on the strength of ZZ$\gamma$ and Z$\gamma\gamma$ couplings.'
