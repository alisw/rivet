Description:
  'Differential cross-sections of properties of the four leading jets in
  $W$+jets production, using the full 2010 dataset of 36 pb$^-1$. Observables
  include jet multiplicities, $pT$, $H_T$, angular distances, and others.
  All observables are available using jets with $pT>30$ and $pT>20$ GeV.'
