Description:
  Differential cross sections for the production of at least four jets have been measured in proton-proton collisions at
  $\sqrt{s}=8$\,TeV at the Large Hadron Collider using the ATLAS detector. The dataset corresponds to an integrated luminosity
  of 20.3\,fb^{-1}. The cross sections are corrected for detector effects and presented as a function of the jet momenta,
  invariant masses, minimum and maximum opening angles and other kinematic variables.
