Description:
  'This paper presents measurements of $W^\pm Z$ production in pp collisions at
  a center-of-mass energy of 8 TeV. The gauge bosons are reconstructed using
  their leptonic decay modes into electrons and muons. The data were collected
  in 2012 by the ATLAS experiment at the Large Hadron Collider and correspond to
  an integrated luminosity of 20.3 fb${}^{-1}$. The measured inclusive cross
  section in the detector fiducial region is $\sigma(W^\pm Z\to
  \ell^\prime\nu\ell\ell) = 35.1\pm 0.9$(stat)$\pm 0.8$(sys)$\pm 0.8$(lumi) fb,
  for one leptonic decay channel. In comparison, the next-to-leading-order
  Standard Model expectation is $30.0\pm 2.1$ fb.  Cross sections for $W^+ Z$
  and $W^- Z$ production and their ratio are presented as well as differential
  cross sections for several kinematic observables. Limits on anomalous triple
  gauge boson couplings are derived from the transverse mass spectrum of the
  $W^\pm Z$ system. From the analysis of events with a $W$ and a $Z$ boson
  associated with two or more forward jets an upper limit at 95% confidence
  level on the $W^\pm Z$ scattering cross section of 0.63 fb, for each leptonic
  decay channel, is established, while the Standard Model prediction at
  next-to-leading order is $0.13\pm 0.01$ fb. Limits on anomalous quartic gauge
  boson couplings are also extracted. For distributions that include the
  infinity symbol ($\infty$) on the horizontal axis, the last bin will include
  the events from the overflow bin. Users should note that explicit matching of
  lepton flavour between individual SM neutrinos and charged leptons is used in
  this analysis routine, to match the MC-based correction to the fiducial region
  applied in the paper.  The data are therefore only valid under the assumption
  of the Standard Model and cannot be used for BSM reinterpretation.'
