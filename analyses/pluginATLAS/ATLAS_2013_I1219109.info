Description:
  Measurements of the W+b-jets ($W+b+X$ and $W+b\bar{b}+X$) production cross-section in proton-proton collisions at a
  centre-of-mass energy of 7 TeV at the LHC. These results are based on data corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 
  4.6~$fb^{-1}$, collected with the ATLAS detector. Cross-sections are presented as a function of jet multiplicity and of the 
  transverse momentum of the leading b-jet for both the combined muon and electron decay modes of the W boson. 
  The default routine will consider the average of electron and muon decay channel of the W boson. Use LMODE=EL and 
  LMODE=MU to specify the decay channel directly.
