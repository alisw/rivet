Description:
 'The inclusive cross-section for jet production in association with a $Z$ boson decaying into an electron-positron pair is 
  measured as a function of the transverse momentum and the absolute rapidity of jets using 
  19.9 fb$^{-1}$ of $\sqrt{s}=8$ TeV proton-proton collision data collected with the ATLAS detector 
  at the Large Hadron Collider. 
  The measured Z+ jets cross-section is unfolded to the particle level. 
  The cross-section is compared with state-of-the-art Standard Model calculations, 
  including the next-to-leading-order and next-to-next-to-leading-order perturbative QCD calculations, 
  corrected for non-perturbative and QED radiation effects. 
  The results of the measurements cover final-state jets with transverse momenta up to 1 TeV, 
  and show good agreement with fixed-order calculations.'
