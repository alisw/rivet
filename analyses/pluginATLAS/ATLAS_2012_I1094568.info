RunInfo:
  Require dileptonic ttbar events at 7TeV. It is important to not include semileptonic decay channels in the runs, as they can not be vetoed in the analysis in a generator-independent fashion but have been subtracted from the particle level measurement. The tau decay channels also count as leptonic.

Description:
  'A measurement of the additional jet activity in dileptonic ttbar events. The
  fraction of events passing a veto requirement are shown as a function the veto
  scale for four central rapidity intervals.
  Two veto definitions are used: events are vetoed if they contain an additional
  jet in the rapidity interval with transverse momentum above a threshold, or
  alternatively, if the scalar transverse momentum sum of all additional jets
  in the rapidity interval is above a threshold.'
