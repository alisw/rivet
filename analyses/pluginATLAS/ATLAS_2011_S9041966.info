Description:
  'Single and dilepton search for first and second generation scalar leptoquarks
  by ATLAS at 7 TeV.  Event counts in four signal regions (single lepton and
  dilepton for first and second generation) are implemented as one-bin
  histograms.  Histograms for event transverse energy are implemented for
  dilepton signal regions and histograms for leptoquark mass are implemented for
  single lepton signal regions.  Histograms for observables in six control
  regions are implemented.'
