Description:
  'A measurement of the splitting scales occuring in the $k_\text{t}$ jet-clustering algorithm is presented for final states containing
  a $Z$ boson. The measurement is done using 20.2 fb$^{-1}$ of proton-proton collision data collected at a centre-of-mass energy of
  $\sqrt{s} = 8$ TeV by the ATLAS experiment at the LHC in 2012. The measurement is based on charged-particle track information,
  which is measured with excellent precision in the $p_\text{T}$ region relevant for the transition between the perturbative and the
  non-perturbative regimes. The data distributions are corrected for detector effects, and are found to deviate from
  state-of-the-art predictions in various regions of the observables. If no mode specified, will try to fill both electron and muon plots. If EL or MU
  is specified, only the relevant plots will be filled.'
