Description:
  'Two-particle angular correlations are measured in proton-proton collisions at
  $\sqrt(s)=900$ GeV and 7 TeV.  Correlations are determined for charged 
  particles with $\pT > 100 MeV$ and $|\eta| < 2.5$.  A complicated function of 
  both pseudorapidity and azimuth is observed.  Results are obtained from an 
  inclusive sample of events (900 GeV and 7 TeV), as well as a sample satisfying
   $n_{ch} \ge 20$ (7 TeV only).'
