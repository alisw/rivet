Description:
  'High-precision measurements by the ATLAS Collaboration are presented of inclusive $W^+\to\ell^+$, $W^-\to\ell^-$,
  $Z/\gamma^\ast\to\ell\ell$ ($\ell=e,\mu$) Drell-Yan production cross sections at the LHC. The data were collected
  in proton-proton collisions at $\sqrt{s}=7$ TeV with an integrated luminosity of 4.6 fb${}^{-1}$. Differential
  $W^+$ and $W^-$ cross sections are measured in a lepton pseudorapidity range $|\eta_\ell| < 2.5$. Differential
  $Z/\gamma^\ast$ cross sections are measured as a function of the absolute dilepton rapidity, for $|y_{\ell\ell}| < 3.6$,
  for three intervals of dilepton mass, $m_{\ell\ell}$, extending from 46 to 150 GeV. The integrated and differential
  electron- and muon-channel cross sections are combined and compared to theoretical predictions using recent sets of
  parton distribution functions. The data, together with the final inclusive $e^\pm p$ scattering cross-section data
  from H1 and ZEUS, are interpreted in a next-to-next-to-leading-order QCD analysis, and a new set of parton distribution
  functions, ATLAS-epWZ16, is obtained. The ratio of strange-to-light sea-quark densities in the proton is determined
  more accurately than in previous determinations based on collider data only, and is established to be close to unity in
  the sensitivity range of the data. A new measurement of the CKM matrix element $|V_{cs}|$ is also provided.
  N.B.: Use :LMODE to choose specify the signature decay channel directly. 
        Default, run everything, assuming all decay modes are generated 
        Contains Z (W): fill only Z (W) signature histgrams
        Contains EL (MU): assume only electron (muon) decay modes are being generated.'
