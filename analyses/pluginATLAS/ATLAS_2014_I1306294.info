Description:
  'Measurements of differential production cross-sections of a $Z$
   boson in association with $b$-jets in $pp$ collisions at $\sqrt{s}=7$
   TeV are reported. The data analysed correspond to an integrated
   luminosity of 4.6~fb$^{-1}$ recorded with the ATLAS detector at the
   Large Hadron Collider. Particle-level cross-sections are determined
   for events with a $Z$ boson decaying into an electron or muon pair,
   and containing $b$-jets. For events with at least one $b$-jet, the
   cross-section is presented as a function of the $Z$ boson transverse
   momentum and rapidity, together with the inclusive $b$-jet
   cross-section as a function of $b$-jet transverse momentum, rapidity
   and angular separations between the $b$-jet and the $Z$ boson. For
   events with at least two $b$-jets, the cross-section is determined as
   a function of the invariant mass and angular separation of the two
   highest transverse momentum $b$-jets, and as a function of the $Z$
   boson transverse momentum and rapidity. Results are compared to
   leading-order and next-to-leading-order perturbative QCD
   calculations.
   This Rivet module implements the event selection for Z decaying into electrons.
