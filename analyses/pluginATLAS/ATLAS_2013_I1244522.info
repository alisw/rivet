Description:
  Measurements of isolated photon plus jet production in $pp$ collisions at a centre-of-mass energy of 7~TeV with the  ATLAS detector
  at the LHC using an integrated luminosity of $37~\text{pb}^{-1}$. Differential cross sections are presented as functions of photon
  transverse energy, jet transverse momentum and jet rapidity. In addition, the differential cross sections as functions of the 
  difference between the azimuthal angles of the photon and the jet, the photon-jet invariant mass as well as the scattering angle 
  in the photon-jet centre-of-mass frame have been measured.
