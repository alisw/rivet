Description: 
  'The dynamics of isolated-photon production in association with a jet in proton--proton collisions at a centre-of-mass energy of 
  13 TeV are studied with the ATLAS detector at the LHC using a dataset with an integrated luminosity of 3.2 fb${}^{-1}$. 
  Photons are required to have transverse energies above 125 GeV. Jets are identified using the anti-$k_\text{t}$ algorithm 
  with radius parameter $R=0.4$ and required to have transverse momenta above 100 GeV. Measurements of isolated-photon plus jet 
  cross sections are presented as functions of the leading-photon transverse energy, the leading-jet transverse momentum, 
  the azimuthal angular separation between the photon and the jet, the photon--jet invariant mass and the scattering angle 
  in the photonâ€“jet centre-of-mass system. Tree-level plus parton-shower predictions from Sherpa and Pythia as well as 
  next-to-leading-order QCD predictions from Jetphox and Sherpa are compared to the measurements.'
