Description:
   'A measurement of event-shape variables in proton−proton collisions at large momentum transfer 
   is presented using data collected at s√=13 TeV with the ATLAS detector at the Large Hadron Collider. 
   Six event-shape variables calculated using hadronic jets are studied in inclusive multijet 
   events using data corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 139 fb$^{-1}$. 
   Measurements are performed in bins of jet multiplicity and in different ranges 
   of the scalar sum of the transverse momenta of the two leading jets, reaching scales beyond 
   2 TeV. These measurements are compared with predictions from Monte Carlo event 
   generators containing leading-order or next-to-leading order matrix elements matched 
   to parton showers simulated to leading-logarithm accuracy. At low jet multiplicities, 
   shape discrepancies between the measurements and the Monte Carlo predictions are observed. 
   At high jet multiplicities, the shapes are better described but discrepancies 
   in the normalisation are observed.'
