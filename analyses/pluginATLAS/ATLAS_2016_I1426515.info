Description:
  'The production of $W$ boson pairs in proton--proton collisions at $\sqrt{s} =
  8$ TeV is studied using data corresponding to 20.3 fb${}^{-1}$ of integrated
  luminosity collected by the ATLAS detector during 2012 at the CERN Large
  Hadron Collider. The $W$ bosons are reconstructed using their leptonic decays
  into electrons or muons and neutrinos. Events with reconstructed jets are not
  included in the candidate event sample. A total of 6636 $WW$ candidate events
  are observed. Measurements are performed in fiducial regions closely
  approximating the detector acceptance. The integrated measurement is corrected
  for all acceptance effects and for the $W$ branching fractions to leptons in
  order to obtain the total $WW$ production cross section, which is found to be
  $71.1 \pm 1.1$ (stat) ${}^{+5.7}_{-5.0}$ (syst) $\pm 1.4$ (lumi) pb. This
  agrees with the next-to-next-to-leading-order Standard Model prediction of
  $63.2 {}^{+1.6}_{-1.4}$ (scale) $\pm 1.2$ (PDF) pb. Fiducial differential
  cross sections are measured as a function of each of six kinematic
  variables. The distribution of the transverse momentum of the leading lepton
  is used to set limits on anomalous triple-gauge-boson couplings.'
