Description:
  'Measurements are made of differential cross-sections of highly boosted pair-produced top quarks as a function of top-quark and
  $t\bar{t}$ system kinematic observables using proton--proton collisions at a center-of-mass energy of $\sqrt{s}=13$ TeV. The data 
  set corresponds to an integrated luminosity of 36.1 fb${}^{-1}$, recorded in 2015 and 2016 with the ATLAS detector at the CERN 
  Large Hadron Collider. Events with two large-radius jets in the final state, one with transverse momentum pT>500 GeV and a second 
  with $p_\text{T} > 350$ GeV, are used for the measurement. The top-quark candidates are separated from the multijet background 
  using jet substructure information and association with a $b$-tagged jet. The measured spectra are corrected for detector effects 
  to a particle-level fiducial phase space and a parton-level limited phase space, and are compared to several Monte Carlo simulations 
  by means of calculated $\chi^2$ values. The cross-section for $t\bar{t}$ production in the fiducial phase-space region is 
  292$\pm$7 (stat)$\pm$76(syst) fb, to be compared to the theoretical prediction of 384$\pm$36 fb.'
