Description:
  The W pT at $\sqrt{s} = 7$~TeV is measured using $W\to e \, \nu_e$ and $W\to \mu \, \nu_\mu$
  decay channels. The dressed leptons kinematics calculated from the sum of the post-FSR
  lepton momentum and the momenta of all photons radiated in a cone around the lepton,
  while the bare uses the lepton kinematics after all QED radiation.
