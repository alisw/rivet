Description:
  'The dijet production cross section for jets containing a $b$-hadron ($b$-jets) has been measured in proton-proton collisions 
  with a centre-of-mass energy of $\sqrt{s} = 7$ TeV, using the ATLAS detector at the LHC. The data used correspond to an 
  integrated luminosity of 4.2 fb$^{-1}$. The cross section is measured for events with two identified $b$-jets with a 
  transverse momentum $p_\mathrm{T} > 20$GeV and a minimum separation in the $\eta$-$\phi$ plane of $\Delta R$ = 0.4. 
  At least one of the jets in the event is required to have $p_\mathrm{T} > 270$GeV. The cross section is measured 
  differentially as a function of dijet invariant mass, dijet transverse momentum, boost of the dijet system, and the 
  rapidity difference, azimuthal angle and angular distance between the $b$-jets. The results are compared to different 
  predictions of leading order and next-to-leading order perturbative quantum chromodynamics matrix elements supplemented 
  with models for parton-showers and hadronization.'
