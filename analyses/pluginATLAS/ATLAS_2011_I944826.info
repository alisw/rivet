Description:
  'The production of $K_S$ and $\Lambda$ hadrons is studied in inelastic $pp$ collisions
   at $\sqrt{s} = 0.9$ and 7 TeV collected with the ATLAS detector at the LHC using a
   minimum-bias trigger. The observed distributions of transverse momentum, rapidity,
   and multiplicity are corrected to hadron level in a model-independent way within
   well defined phase-space regions. The distribution of the production ratio of $\bar{\Lambda}$
   to $\Lambda$ baryons is also measured. The results are compared with various Monte
   Carlo simulation models. Although most of these models agree with data to within
   15 percent in the $K_S$ distributions, substantial disagreements with data are found
   in the $\Lambda$ distributions of transverse momentum.'
