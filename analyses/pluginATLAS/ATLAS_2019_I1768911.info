Description:
  'This paper describes precision measurements of the transverse
  momentum $p_\mathrm{T}^{\ell\ell}$ ($\ell=e,\mu$) and of the angular
  variable $\phi^{*}_{\eta}$ distributions of Drell-Yan lepton pairs
  in a mass range of 66-116 GeV. The analysis uses data from 36.1
  fb$^{-1}$ of proton-proton collisions at a centre-of-mass energy of
  $\sqrt{s}=13$ TeV collected by the ATLAS experiment at the LHC in
  2015 and 2016. Measurements in electron-pair and muon-pair final
  states are performed in the same fiducial volumes, corrected for
  detector effects, and combined. Compared to previous measurements in
  proton-proton collisions at $\sqrt{s}=$7 and 8 TeV, this new
  measurement probes perturbative QCD at a higher centre-of-mass
  energy with a different composition of initial states. It reaches a
  precision of 0.2% for the normalized spectra at low values of
  $p_\mathrm{T}^{\ell\ell}$. The data are compared with different QCD
  predictions, where it is found that predictions based on resummation
  approaches can describe the full spectrum within uncertainties.
  Decay channel (e or mu) is selected by LMODE=EL,MU. The comparison is always to the combined measurement.'
