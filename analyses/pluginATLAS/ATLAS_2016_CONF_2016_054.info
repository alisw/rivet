Description:
  'A search for squarks and gluinos in final states with an isolated electron or
  muon, multiple jets and large missing transverse momentum using proton--proton
  collision data at a centre-of-mass energy of $\sqrt{s} = 13~\TeV$. The dataset
  corresponds to an integrated luminosity of 14.8/fb, recorded in 2015 and 2016
  by the ATLAS experiment at the Large Hadron Collider.'
