Description:
  'The production of $Z$ bosons with one or two isolated high-energy photons is studied using pp collisions at $\sqrt{s}=8$ TeV.
  The analyses use a data sample with an integrated luminosity of 20.3 fb${}^{-1}$ collected by the ATLAS detector during the
  2012 LHC data taking. The $Z\gamma$ and $Z\gamma\gamma$ production cross sections are measured with leptonic ($e^+e^-$,
  $\mu^+\mu^-$, $\nu\bar{\nu}$) decays of the Z boson, in extended fiducial regions defined in terms of the lepton and photon
  acceptance. They are then compared to cross-section predictions from the Standard Model, where the sources of the photons are
  radiation off initial-state quarks and radiative Z-boson decay to charged leptons, and from fragmentation of final-state quarks
  and gluons into photons. The yields of events with photon transverse energy $E_\text{T}>250$ GeV from $\ell^+\ell^-\gamma$ events
  and with $E_\text{T}>400$ GeV from $\nu\bar{\nu}\gamma$ events are used to search for anomalous triple gauge-boson couplings
  $ZZ\gamma$ and $Z\gamma\gamma$. The yields of events with diphoton invariant mass $m_{\gamma\gamma}>200$ GeV from
  $\ell^+\ell^-\gamma\gamma$ events and with $m_{\gamma\gamma}>300$ GeV from $\nu\bar{\nu}\gamma\gamma$ events are used to search
  for anomalous quartic gauge-boson couplings $ZZ\gamma\gamma$ and $Z\gamma\gamma\gamma$. No deviations from Standard Model predictions
  are observed and limits are placed on parameters used to describe anomalous triple and quartic gauge-boson couplings.
  The lepton channel can be specified by using the relevant LMODE (EL, MU, NU, LL). The default plugin will fill all of them
  with any events passing the cuts. NU will do only the MET channels, EL & MU will do only the electron or muon and will
  populate the combined plots assuming charged lepton universality. LL with do on the electron and muon but will populate
  the combined plots with the average of the two.'
