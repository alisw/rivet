Description:
  Measurements of normalized differential cross-sections of top-quark pair production are presented as a function of the top-quark,
  $t\bar{t}$ system and event-level kinematic observables in proton-proton collisions at a centre-of-mass energy of 
  $\sqrt{s} = 8$ TeV. The observables have been chosen to emphasize the $t\bar{t}$ production process and to be sensitive to effects 
  of initial- and final-state radiation, to the different parton distribution functions, and to non-resonant processes and higher-order 
  corrections. The dataset corresponds to an integrated luminosity of 20.3 fb${}^{-1}$, recorded in 2012 with the ATLAS detector at the 
  CERN Large Hadron Collider. Events are selected in the lepton$+$jets channel, requiring exactly one charged lepton and at least four 
  jets with at least two of the jets tagged as originating from a $b$-quark. The measured spectra are corrected for detector effects and 
  are compared to several Monte Carlo simulations. The results are in fair agreement with the predictions over a wide kinematic range.
  Nevertheless, most generators predict a harder top-quark transverse momentum distribution at high values than what is observed in
  the data. Predictions beyond NLO accuracy improve the agreement with data at high top-quark transverse momenta. Using the current
  settings and parton distribution functions, the rapidity distributions are not well modelled by any generator under consideration.
  However, the level of agreement is improved when more recent sets of parton distribution functions are used.
