Description:
  'Measurements of the ratio of the production cross sections for $W$ and $Z$ bosons in association with jets in proton-proton
  collisions at $\sqrt{s} = 7$~TeV with the ATLAS experiment at the Large Hadron Collider. The measurement is based on the
  entire 2011 dataset, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 4.6$\text{fb}^{-1}$. Inclusive and differential cross-section ratios
  for massive vector bosons decaying to electrons and muons are measured in association with jets with transverse momentum
  $p_\text{T} > 30$~GeV and jet rapidity $|y| < 4.4$. The default routine will pick up the electron decay channel of the
  heavy bosons and compare it to the combined (muon and electron channel) data. Individual channels (for data) are available
  as well, use ATLAS_2014_I1312627_EL and ATLAS_2014_I1312627_MU to specify the decay channel directly.
  NB #1: The "x01" Scatter2D objects are constructed from the ratio of "x02" to "x03" Histo1D objects. If several output yoda
         files are merged with yodamerge, the merged "x01" objects will become meaningless. New "x01" Scatter2Ds can easil be
         constructed in a postprocessing step from the merged "x02" (nominator) and "x03" (denominator) objects.
  NB #2: Special care ought to be taken when evaluating theoretical uncertainties due to potential cancellations/correlations
         between numerator and denominator.'
