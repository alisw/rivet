Description:
    'Inclusive and differential fiducial cross sections of the Higgs boson are measured in the $H \to ZZ^* \to 4\ell$ ($\ell = e, \mu$) decay
    channel. The results are based on protonâˆ’proton collision data produced at the Large Hadron Collider at a centre-of-mass energy
    of 13 TeV and recorded by the ATLAS detector from 2015 to 2018, equivalent to an integrated luminosity of 139 fb$^{-1}$. The
    inclusive fiducial cross section for the  $H \to ZZ^* \to 4\ell$ process is measured to be  $\sigma_\text{fid} = 3.28 \pm 0.32$ fb, in
    agreement with the Standard Model prediction of  $\sigma_\text{fid, SM} = 3.41 \pm 0.18$ fb. Differential fiducial cross sections are
    measured for a variety of observables which are sensitive to the production and decay of the Higgs boson. All measurements are
    in agreement with the Standard Model predictions. The results are used to constrain anomalous Higgs boson interactions with
    Standard Model particles. For fiducial cross sections, different bin represents cross section measurement in different channels.
    For opposite-flavor cross sections, the branching ratio of Higgs to $4\ell$ of 1.18e$^{-4}$ is used while for same-flavor cross sections,
    1.3e$^{-4}$ is used, which takes interference into consideration. For all other cross sections, a combined branching ratio of
    1.24e$^{-4}$ is used.  In the routine, a Matrix Element calculation based on LO MG is used to assist the pairing of leptons.
    The Higgs to $ZZ$ branching ratio of 0.02641 is multiplied by the $ZZ$ to four lepton branching ratio 0.004736842 and used to scale
    all the histograms except for the $\mathtt{xs\_flavor}$ histograms where bins are scaled by the Higgs to four same flavour leptons branching
    ratio 0.00013 or the Higgs to $ee\mu\mu$ branching ratio 0.000118.'
