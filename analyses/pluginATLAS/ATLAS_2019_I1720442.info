Description:
  'A measurement of the four-lepton invariant mass spectrum is made with the ATLAS detector, using an integrated luminosity of
  36.1 fb$^{-1}$ of proton-proton collisions at $\sqrt{s} = 13$ TeV delivered by the Large Hadron Collider. The differential
  cross-section is measured for events containing two same-flavour opposite-sign lepton pairs. It exhibits a rich structure,
  with different mass regions dominated in the Standard Model by single $Z$ boson production, Higgs boson production, and
  $Z$ boson pair production, and non-negligible interference effects at high invariant masses. The measurement is compared
  with state-of-the-art Standard Model calculations, which are found to be consistent with the data. These calculations are
  used to interpret the data in terms of $gg\to ZZ\to 4\ell$ and $Z\to 4\ell$ subprocesses, and to place constraints on a
  possible contribution from physics beyond the Standard Model.'
