Description:
  'Results of three searches for the production of supersymmetric particles decaying into final
   states with missing transverse momentum and exactly two isolated leptons, electrons or muons.
   The analysis uses a data sample collected during the first half of 2011 that
   corresponds to a total integrated luminosity of 1 $\text{fb}^{-1}$ of $\sqrt{s} = 7$\,TeV
   proton-proton collisions recorded with the ATLAS detector at the Large Hadron Collider.
   Opposite-sign and same-sign dilepton events are studied separately.
   Additionally, in opposite- sign events, a search is made for an excess of same-flavour
   over different-flavour lepton pairs.'
