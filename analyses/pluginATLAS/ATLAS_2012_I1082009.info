Description:
  Measurement of $D^{*\pm}$ meson production in jets from proton-proton collisions
  at a centre-of-mass energy of $\sqrt{s}=7$ TeV at the LHC.
  The measurement is based on a data sample recorded with the ATLAS detector with
  an integrated luminosity of $0.30\,\text{pb}^{-1}$ for jets with transverse momentum
  between 25 and 70 GeV in the pseudorapidity range $|eta| < 2.5$.
