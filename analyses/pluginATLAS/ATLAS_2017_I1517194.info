Description:
  'Measurements of the electroweak production of a $W$ boson in association with two jets at high dijet invariant mass
  are performed using $\sqrt{s} = 7$ and 8 TeV proton-proton collision data produced by the Large Hadron Collider,
  corresponding respectively to 4.7 and 20.2 fb$^{-1}$ of integrated luminosity collected by the ATLAS detector.
  The measurements are sensitive to the production of a $W$ boson via a triple-gauge-boson vertex and include both
  the fiducial and differential cross sections of the electroweak process.'
