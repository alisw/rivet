Description:
  'Search for direct pair production of heavy top-quark partners with 4.7~fb$^{-1}$
  integrated luminosity at $\sqrt{s} = 7 TeV$ by the ATLAS
  experiment. Heavy top-quark partners decaying into a top quark and a neutral
  non-interacting particle are searched for in events with two leptons in the
  final state.'
