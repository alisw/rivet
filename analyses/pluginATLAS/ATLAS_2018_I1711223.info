Description:
  'An observation of electroweak $W^\pm Z$ production in association with two jets in proton-proton collisions is presented. The data
  collected by the ATLAS detector at the Large Hadron Collider in 2015 and 2016 at a centre-of-mass energy of $\sqrt{s}=13$ TeV are used,
  corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 36.1fb$^{-1}$. Events containing three identified leptons, either electrons or muons, and
  two jets are selected. The electroweak production of $W^\pm Z$ bosons in association with two jets is measured with an observed
  significance of 5.3 standard deviations. A fiducial cross-section for electroweak production including interference effects and
  for a single leptonic decay mode is measured to be $\sigma_{WZjj-EW}=0.57-0.13+0.14$(stat.)$-0.06+0.07$(syst.)fb. Total and differential
  fiducial cross-sections of the sum of $W^\pm Zjj$ electroweak and strong productions for several kinematic observables are also
  measured. Uses SM neutrino-lepton flavour matching and a resonant shape algorithm assuming the Standard Model, to match the MC-based 
  correction to the fiducial region applied in the paper. This routine is therefore only valid under the assumption of the Standard Model 
  and cannot be used for BSM reinterpretation'
