Description:
'A measurement of fiducial and differential cross-sections for $W^+W^-$ production in proton--proton collisions at $\sqrt{s}=$13~\TeV\ with the ATLAS experiment at the Large Hadron Collider using data corresponding to an integrated luminosity of $36.1$~fb$^{-1}$ is presented. Events with one electron and one muon are selected, corresponding to the decay of the diboson system as $WW\rightarrow e^{\pm}\nu\mu^{\mp}\nu$. To suppress top-quark background, events containing jets with a transverse momentum exceeding 35~\GeV\ are not included in the measurement phase space. 
The fiducial cross-section, six differential distributions and the cross-section as a function of the jet-veto transverse momentum threshold are measured and compared with several theoretical predictions. 
Constraints on anomalous electroweak gauge boson self-interactions are also presented in the framework of a dimension-six effective field theory.'
