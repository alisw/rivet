Description:
  Measurements of the differential fiducial cross sections for the production of a W or Z boson in association with a high-energy
  photon are measured using pp collisions at $\sqrt{s}=7~\TeV$. The analysis uses a data sample with an integrated luminosity of
  4.6/fb collected by the ATLAS detector during the 2011 LHC data-taking period. Events are selected using leptonic decays
  of the W or Z bosons with the requirement of an associated isolated photon. The default routine will consider the electron decay
  channel of the Z boson. Use LMODE to specify the decay channel directly.
