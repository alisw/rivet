Description:
  'This paper presents a measurement of quantities related to the formation of jets from 
   high-energy quarks and gluons (fragmentation). Jets with transverse momentum 
   100 GeV $< p_T <$ 2.5 TeV and pseudorapidity $|\eta|<2.1$ from an integrated luminosity of 
   33 fb$^{âˆ’1}$ of $\sqrt{s}=$13 TeV proton-proton collisions are reconstructed with the ATLAS detector 
   at the Large Hadron Collider. Charged-particle tracks with $p_T >$ 500 MeV and $|\eta|<2.5$ 
   are used to probe the detailed structure of the jet. The fragmentation properties of the more 
   forward and the more central of the two leading jets from each event are studied. 
   The data are unfolded to correct for detector resolution and acceptance effects. 
   Comparisons with parton shower Monte Carlo generators indicate that existing models 
   provide a reasonable description of the data across a wide range of phase space, 
   but there are also significant differences. Furthermore, the data are interpreted 
   in the context of quark- and gluon-initiated jets by exploiting the rapidity dependence 
   of the jet flavor fraction. A first measurement of the charged-particle multiplicity 
   using model-independent jet labels (topic modeling) provides a promising alternative 
   to traditional quark and gluon extractions using input from simulation. 
   The simulations provide a reasonable description of the quark-like data across the jet 
   $p_T$ range presented in this measurement, but the gluon-like data have systematically 
   fewer charged particles than the simulations.'
