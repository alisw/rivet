Description:
  The distribution and orientation of energy inside jets is predicted to be an experimental handle on colour connections between the
  hard-scatter quarks and gluons initiating the jets. This is a measurement of the distribution of one such variable, the jet pull angle.
  The pull angle is measured for jets produced in $t\bar{t}$ events with one $W$ boson decaying leptonically and the other decaying to
  jets using 20.3\,$\text{fb}^{-1}$ of data recorded with the ATLAS detector at a centre-of-mass energy of $\sqrt{s} = 8$\,TeV at the LHC.
  The jet pull angle distribution is corrected for detector resolution and acceptance effects.
