Description:
  'The analysis of the momentum difference between charged hadrons in high-energy proton-proton collisions is performed in order to
  study coherent particle production. The observed correlation pattern agrees with a model of a helical QCD string fragmenting into
  a chain of ground-state hadrons. A threshold momentum difference in the production of adjacent pairs of charged hadrons is
  observed, in agreement with model predictions. The presence of low-mass hadron chains also explains the emergence of
  charge-combination-dependent two-particle correlations commonly attributed to Bose-Einstein interference. The data sample consists
  of 190 $\mu\text{b}^{-1}$ of minimum-bias events collected with proton-proton collisions at a center-of-mass energy 
  $\sqrt{s}$ = 7 TeV in the early low-luminosity data taking with the ATLAS detector at the LHC.'
