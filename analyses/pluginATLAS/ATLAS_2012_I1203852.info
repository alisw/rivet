Description:
  'Measurement of the fiducial cross section for $ZZ(*)$ production in proton proton collisions
   at a centre-of mass energy of 7 TeV, is presented, using data corresponding to an integrated
   luminosity of 4.6/fb collected by the ATLAS experiment at the Large Hadron Collider. The
   cross-section is measured using processes with two $Z$ bosons decaying to electrons or muons
   or with one $Z$ boson decaying to electrons or muons and a second $Z$ boson decaying to neutrinos.
   The fiducial region contains dressed leptons in restricted $p_T$ and $\eta$ ranges. The
   selection has specific requirements for both production processes. A measurement of the
   normalized fiducial cross-section as a function of $ZZ$ invariant mass, leading $Z$ $p_T$ and
   angle of two leptons coming from the leading $Z$ is also presented for both signal processes.'
