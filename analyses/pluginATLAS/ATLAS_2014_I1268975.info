Description:
  'Double-differential dijet cross sections measured in pp collisions
   at the LHC with a 7 TeV centre-of-mass energy are presented as
   functions of dijet mass and rapidity separation of the two highest-pT
   jets. These measurements are obtained using data corresponding to an
   integrated luminosity of 4.5/fb, recorded by the ATLAS detector in
   2011. The data are corrected for detector effects so that cross
   sections are presented at the particle level. Cross sections are
   measured up to 5 TeV dijet mass using jets reconstructed with the
   anti-kt algorithm for values of the jet radius parameter of 0.4 and
   0.6. The cross sections are compared with next-to-leading-order
   perturbative QCD calculations by NLOJET++ corrected to account for
   non-perturbative effects. Comparisons with POWHEG predictions, using a
   next-to-leading-order matrix element calculation interfaced to a
   parton-shower Monte Carlo simulation, are also shown. Electroweak
   effects are accounted for in both cases. The quantitative comparison
   of data and theoretical predictions obtained using various
   parameterizations of the parton distribution functions is performed
   using a frequentist method. An example setting a lower limit on the
   compositeness scale for a model of contact interactions is presented,
   showing that the unfolded results can be used to constrain
   contributions to dijet production beyond that predicted by the
   Standard Model.'
