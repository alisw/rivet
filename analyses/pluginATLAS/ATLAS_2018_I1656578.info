Description:
  'Measurements of differential cross sections of top quark pair production in association with jets by the ATLAS experiment at the
  LHC are presented. The measurements are performed as functions of the top quark transverse momentum, the transverse momentum of
  the top quark-antitop quark system and the out-of-plane transverse momentum using data from pp collisions at $\sqrt{s}=13$ TeV
  collected by the ATLAS detector at the LHC in 2015 and corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 3.2 $\text{fb}^{-1}$. The top quark
  pair events are selected in the lepton (electron or muon) + jets channel. The measured cross sections, which are compared to several
  predictions, allow a detailed study of top quark production.'
