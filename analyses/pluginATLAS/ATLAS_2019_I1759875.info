Description: 
    'The inclusive top quark pair ($t\bar{t}$) production cross-section $\sigma_{t\bar{t}}$ has been measured in proton-proton 
    collisions at $\sqrt{s}=13$ TeV, using 36.1 fb$^{-1}$ of data collected in 2015-2016 by the ATLAS experiment at the LHC. 
    Using events with an opposite-charge $e\mu$ pair and $b$-tagged jets, the cross-section is measured to be: 
    $\sigma_{t\bar{t}} = 826.4 \pm 3.6$ (stat) $\pm 11.5$ (syst) $\pm 15.7$ (lumi) $\pm 1.9$ (beam) pb, where the uncertainties reflect 
    the limited size of the data sample, experimental and theoretical systematic effects, the integrated luminosity, 
    and the LHC beam energy, giving a total uncertainty of 2.4%. The result is consistent with theoretical QCD calculations 
    at next-to-next-to-leading order. It is used to determine the top quark pole mass via the dependence of the predicted 
    cross-section on $m_t^{\mathrm{pole}}$, giving $m_t^{\mathrm{pole}}=173.1^{+2.0}_{-2.1}$ GeV. It is also combined with 
    measurements at $\sqrt{s}=7$ TeV and $\sqrt{s}=8$ TeV to derive ratios and double ratios of $t\bar{t}$ and $Z$ cross-sections 
    at different energies. The same event sample is used to measure absolute and normalised differential cross-sections as functions 
    of single-lepton and dilepton kinematic variables, and the results are compared with predictions from various Monte Carlo event
    generators.'
