Description:
  The first jet cross section measurement made with the ATLAS detector at the LHC.
  Anti-kt jets with $R=0.4$ and $R=0.6$ are resconstructed within
   $|y|<2.8$ and above 60~GeV for the inclusive jet
  cross section plots.  For the di-jet plots the second jet must have pT>30~GeV.
  Jet pT and di-jet mass spectra are plotted in bins of rapidity between $|y| = $
  0.3, 0.8, 1.2, 2.1, and 2.8.  Di-jet $\chi$ spectra are plotted in bins of
  di-jet mass between 340 GeV, 520 GeV, 800 GeV and 1200 GeV.
