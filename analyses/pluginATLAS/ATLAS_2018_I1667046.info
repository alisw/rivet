Description:
  'This search uses 36.1/fb of data collected by the ATLAS detector in proton-proton
  collisions with a center-of-mass energy of $\sqrt{s}=13$ TeV at the LHC. The analysis
  is performed using requirements on the number of jets and the number of jets tagged
  as containing a $b$-hadron, as well as a topological observable formed by the scalar
  sum of masses of large-radius jets in the event. No significant excess above the
  expected Standard Model background was observed.'
