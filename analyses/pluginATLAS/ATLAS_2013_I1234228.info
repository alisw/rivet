Description:
  This Letter reports a measurement of the high-mass Drell-Yan differential cross-section in proton-proton collisions at a
  centre-of-mass energy of 7 TeV at the LHC. Based on an integrated luminosity of 4.9 fb$^{-1}$, the differential cross-section in the
  $Z/\gamma^\ast \rightarrow e^+e^-$ channel is measured with the ATLAS detector as a function of the invariant mass, $m_{ee}$, in the range
  $116< m_{ee} <1500$ GeV, for a fiducial region in which both the electron and the positron have transverse momentum $p_\text{T}>25$ GeV and
  pseudorapidity $|\eta|<2.5$. A comparison is made to various event generators and to the predictions of perturbative QCD calculations
  at next-to-next-to-leading order.
