  kinematic $\pT$ cut samples, or merging from slices or $\pT$-enhanced sampling is advised.

Description:
  Measurement of jet shapes in inclusive jet production in $pp$ collisions at 7 TeV
  based on 3 pb$^{-1}$ of data. Jets are reconstructed in $|\eta| < 5$ using the
  anti-$k_\perp$ algorithm with $30 < \pT < 600$ GeV and $|y| < 2.8$.
