Description:
   The four-lepton (4$\ell$, $\ell = e,\mu$) production cross section is measured in the mass range from 80 to 1000 GeV
   using 20.3 fb$^{-1}$ of data in $pp$ collisions at $\sqrt{s}=8$ TeV collected with the ATLAS detector at the LHC.
   The $4\ell$ events are produced in the decays of resonant $Z$ and Higgs bosons and the non-resonant $ZZ$ continuum
   originating from $q\bar{q}$, $gg$, $qg$ initial states. A total of 476 signal candidate events are observed with a
   background expectation of 26.2$\pm$3.6 events, enabling the measurement of the integrated cross section and the
   differential cross section as a function of the invariant mass and transverse momentum of the four-lepton system.
