Description:
  'Results of the search for the production of supersymmetric particles decaying into final
   states with missing transverse momentum and two isolated same-sign leptons, electrons or muons.
   The analysis uses a data sample collected during the first half of 2012 that
   corresponds to a total integrated luminosity o1 $5.8\,\text{fb}^{-1}$ of $\sqrt{s} = 8$\,TeV
   proton-proton collisions recorded with the ATLAS detector at the Large Hadron Collider.
   Opposite-sign and same-sign dilepton events are studied separately.'
