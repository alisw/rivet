Description:
  First measurement of $W^\pm W^\pm jj$, same-electric-charge diboson production in association with two jets, using
  $20.3 {\rmâ€‰fb}^{-1}$ of proton-proton collision data at $\sqrt{s} = 8$\,TeV recorded by the ATLAS detector at the
  Large Hadron Collider. Events with two reconstructed same-charge leptons ($e^\pm e^\pm$, $e^\pm \mu^\pm$, and
  $\mu^\pm \mu^\pm$) and two or more jets are analyzed. Production cross sections are measured in two fiducial regions,
  with different sensitivities to the electroweak and strong production mechanisms. First evidence
  for $W^\pm W^\pm j j$ production and electroweak-only $W^\pm W^\pm jj$ production is observed with a significance of
  4.5 and 3.6 standard deviations, respectively.
