Description:
  A measurement of angular correlations in Drell-Yan lepton pairs via the $\phi^*$ observable is presented. This
  variable probes the same physics as the $Z/\gamma^*$  boson transverse momentum with a better experimental
  resolution. The $Z/\gamma^* \to ee$ and $Z/\gamma^* \to \mu \mu$ decays produced in proton--proton collisions
  at a centre-of-mass energy of $\sqrt{s} = 7\;\TeV$ are used. Normalised differential cross sections as a
  function of $\phi^*$ are measured separately for electron and muon decay channels. The cross-section is also
  measured double differentially as a function of $\phi^*$ for three independent bins of the $Z$ boson rapidity.
