Description:
  'Preliminary measurements of the cross-section for the production of a $Z$
  boson in association with jets in $pp$ collisions at $\sqrt{s} = 13$\,TeV are
  presented, using data corresponding to an integrated luminosity of
  $85\,\text{pb}^{-1}$ collected by the ATLAS experiment at the Large Hadron
  Collider. The cross-sections are measured for events containing a $Z$ boson
  decaying to electrons or muons and produced in association with up to four
  jets in the kinematical range of $p_\text{T} > 30$\,GeV and $|y| < 2.5$.
