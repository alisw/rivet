Description:
  'The ATLAS experiment at the LHC has measured the production cross
  section of events with two isolated photons in the final state, in
  proton-proton collisions at $\sqrt{s} = 7$ TeV. The full data set
  collected in 2011, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 4.9
  fb$^{-1}$, is used. The amount of background, from hadronic jets and
  isolated electrons, is estimated with data-driven techniques and
  subtracted. The total cross section, for two isolated photons with
  transverse energies above 25 GeV and 22 GeV respectively, in the
  acceptance of the electromagnetic calorimeter ($|\eta|<1.37$ and
  $1.52<|\eta|<2.37$) and with an angular separation $\Delta R>0.4$, is
  $44.0^{+3.2}_{-4.2}$ pb. The differential cross sections as a function of the
  di-photon invariant mass, transverse momentum, azimuthal separation,
  and cosine of the polar angle of the largest transverse energy photon
  in the Collins--Soper di-photon rest frame are also measured. The
  results are compared to the prediction of leading-order parton-shower
  and next-to-leading-order and next-to-next-to-leading-order
  parton-level generators.'
