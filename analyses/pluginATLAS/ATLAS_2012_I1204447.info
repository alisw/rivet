Description:
  'A generic search for anomalous production of events with at least
   three charged leptons is presented. The search uses a pp-collision
   data sample at a center-of-mass energy of $\sqrt{s}$ = 7 TeV
   corresponding to 4.6/fb of integrated luminosity collected in 2011
   by the ATLAS detector at the CERN Large Hadron Collider. Events are
   required to contain at least two electrons or muons, while the
   third lepton may either be an additional electron or muon, or a
   hadronically decaying tau lepton. Events are categorized by the
   presence or absence of a reconstructed tau-lepton or Z-boson
   candidate decaying to leptons. No significant excess above
   backgrounds expected from Standard Model processes is
   observed. Results are presented as upper limits on event
   yields from non-Standard-Model processes producing at least three
   prompt, isolated leptons, given as functions of lower bounds on
   several kinematic variables. Fiducial efficiencies for model testing
   are also provided.

   This Rivet module implements the event selection and the fiducial
   efficiencies to test various models for their exclusion based on
   observed/excluded limits.'
