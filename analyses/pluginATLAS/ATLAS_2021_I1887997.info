Description:
'Fiducial and differential measurements of $\gamma\gamma$ production.
The photons are required to be isolated and have a transverse momentum of $p_{\mathrm{T}}>40(30)$ GeV for the leading (sub-leading) photon. The differential cross sections as functions of several observables for the diphoton system are measured.'
