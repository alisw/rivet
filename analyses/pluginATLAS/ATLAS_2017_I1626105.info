Description:
  'This paper presents single lepton and dilepton kinematic distributions measured in dileptonic $t\bar{t}$ events produced in
  20.2 fb${}^{-1}$ of $\sqrt{s} = 8$ TeV $pp$ collisions recorded by the ATLAS experiment at the LHC. Both absolute and normalised
  differential cross-sections are measured, using events with an opposite-charge $e\mu$ pair and one or two $b$-tagged jets.
  The cross-sections are measured in a fiducial region corresponding to the detector acceptance for leptons, and are compared
  to the predictions from a variety of Monte Carlo event generators, as well as fixed-order QCD calculations, exploring the
  sensitivity of the cross-sections to the gluon parton distribution function. Some of the distributions are also sensitive to
  the top quark pole mass, a combined fit of NLO fixed-order predictions to all the measured distributions yields a top quark
  mass value of $m_t^\text{pole} = 173.2 \pm 0.9 \pm 0.8 \pm 1.2$ GeV, where the three uncertainties arise from data statistics,
  experimental systematics, and theoretical sources.'
