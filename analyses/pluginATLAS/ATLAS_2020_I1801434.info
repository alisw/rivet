Description:
  'Differential cross-sections are measured for top-quark pair production in the all-hadronic decay mode, 
  using proton-proton collision events collected by the ATLAS experiment in which all six decay jets 
  are separately resolved. Absolute and normalised single- and double-differential cross-sections 
  are measured at particle and parton level as a function of various kinematic variables. 
  Emphasis is placed on well-measured observables in fully reconstructed final states, 
  as well as on the study of correlations between the top-quark pair system 
  and additional jet radiation identified in the event. 
  The study is performed using data from proton-proton collisions at $\sqrt{s} = 13$ TeV collected 
  by the ATLAS detector at CERN’s Large Hadron Collider in 2015 and 2016, corresponding 
  to an integrated luminosity of 36.1 fb$^{−1}$. The rapidities of the individual top quarks 
  and of the top-quark pair are well modelled by several independent event generators. 
  Significant mismodelling is observed in the transverse momenta of the leading three jet emissions, 
  while the leading top-quark transverse momentum and top-quark pair transverse momentum 
  are both found to be incompatible with several theoretical predictions'
