Description:
  'Pseudorapidity gap distributions in proton-proton collisions at $\sqrt{s} = 7$ TeV
  are studied using a minimum bias data sample with an integrated luminosity of 7.1
  inverse microbarns. Cross sections are measured differentially in terms of $\Delta \eta_F$,
  the larger of the pseudorapidity regions extending to the limits of the ATLAS sensitivity,
  at $\eta = \pm 4.9$, in which no final state particles are produced above a transverse momentum
  threshold $\pT$ cut. The measurements span the region $0 < \Delta \eta_F < 8$ for
  $200 < p_T\text{ cut} < 800\;\MeV$. At small $\Delta \eta_F$, the data test the reliability of hadronisation
  models in describing rapidity and transverse momentum fluctuations in final state particle
  production. The measurements at larger gap sizes are dominated by contributions from the single
  diffractive dissociation process ($pp \to Xp$), enhanced by double dissociation ($pp \to XY$) where
  the invariant mass of the lighter of the two dissociation systems satisfies $M_Y \lesssim 7\;\GeV$.
  The resulting cross section is $\mathrm{d} \sigma / \mathrm{d} \Delta \eta_F \sim 1$ mb for
  $\Delta \eta_F \gtrsim 3$. The large rapidity gap data are used to constrain the value of
  the pomeron intercept appropriate to triple Regge models of soft diffraction. The cross section
  integrated over all gap sizes is compared with other LHC inelastic cross section measurements. '
