Description: 
  'The cross section of a top-quark pair produced in association with a photon is measured in proton-proton collisions 
  at a centre-of-mass energy of $\sqrt{s} = 8$ TeV with 20.2 fb${}^{-1}$ of data collected by the ATLAS detector at the 
  Large Hadron Collider in 2012. The measurement is performed by selecting events that contain a photon with transverse 
  momentum $p_\text{T} > 15$ GeV, an isolated lepton with large transverse momentum, large missing transverse momentum, 
  and at least four jets, where at least one is identified as originating from a $b$-quark. The production cross section 
  is measured in a fiducial region close to the selection requirements. It is found to be $139 \pm 7$ (stat.) $\pm 17$ (syst.) fb,
  in good agreement with the theoretical prediction at next-to-leading order of $151 \pm 24$ fb. In addition, differential 
  cross sections in the fiducial region are measured as a function of the transverse momentum and pseudorapidity of the photon.'
