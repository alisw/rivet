Description:
     Fiducial cross-section for $Wt+t\bar{t}$ production in events with two leptons and exactly one jet, using an integrated
     luminosity of 20.3 fb${}^{-1}$ of proton-proton collisions at a centre-of-mass energy of 8 TeV at the Large Hadron Collider,
     collected with the ATLAS detector. The cross-section for the production of a top quark and a $W$ boson is measured in a
     fiducial acceptance requiring two leptons with $\pT > 25$ GeV and $|\eta| < 2.5$, one jet with $\pT > 20$ GeV
     and $|\eta| < 2.5$, and $E^\text{miss}_\text{T} > 20$ GeV, including both $Wt$ and top-quark pair events as signal.
     The measured value of the fiducial cross-section is $0.85 \pm 0.01$ (stat.) $\pm 0.07$ (syst.) $\pm 0.03$ (lumi.) pb.
