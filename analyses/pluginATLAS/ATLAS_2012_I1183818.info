Description:
  'The measurement of the sum of the transverse energy of particles as a
   function of particle pseudorapidity, eta, in proton-proton collisions
   at a centre-of-mass energy, $\sqrt{s} = 7\;\TeV$ using the ATLAS detector
   at the Large Hadron Collider. The measurements are performed in the
   region $|\eta| < 4.8$ for two event classes: those requiring the presence
   of particles with a low transverse momentum and those requiring
   particles with a significant transverse momentum (dijet events where both
   jets have $E_T > 20$ GeV). In the second dataset measurements are made
   in the region transverse to the hard scatter.'
