RunInfo:
  p + p -> W + X ( W -> mu nu or e nu )
  The histograms include the $W$ charge asymmetry. Note that the charge asymmetry histograms may
  need to be constructed manually from the individual $W^+$ and $W^-$ channels if the analysis is
  run on individual files. $A_l = (W^+ - W^-) / (W^+ + W^-)$

Description:
  The production cross sections of the inclusive Drell-Yan process $W^\pm \rightarrow \ell\nu$
  ($\ell = e, \mu$) are measured in proton-proton collisions at $\sqrt{s} = 7$~TeV with the ATLAS detector.
  The cross sections are evaluated differentially as a function of the $W$ boson rapidity based on an
  integrated luminosity of about 35~$\text{pb}^{-1}$ collected in 2010. The cross sections are measured
  separately for $W^+$ and $W^-$ production, and then used to construct the $W$ charge asymmetry as well.
