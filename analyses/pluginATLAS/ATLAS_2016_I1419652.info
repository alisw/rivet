Description:
  Measurements from proton-proton collisions at centre-of-mass energy
  of $\sqrt{s} = 13$ TeV recorded with the ATLAS detector at
  the LHC. Events were collected using a single-arm minimum-bias
  trigger. The charged-particle multiplicity, its dependence on
  transverse momentum and pseudorapidity and the relationship between
  the mean transverse momentum and charged-particle multiplicity are
  measured. The observed distributions are corrected to well-defined
  phase-space regions ($p_\text{T} > 500$ MeV and $|\eta| < 2.5$ of the particles),
  using model-independent corrections.
