Description:
  'A search for high-mass dielectron and dimuon resonances in the mass range of 250 GeV to
   6 TeV. Functional forms have been fitted to the components of Crystal Ball + Gaussian
   dilepton invariant-mass distribution smearing functions for electrons and muons separately,
   which are encoded in this analysis to allow particle-level MC to be compared to the
   reco-level experimental data.'
