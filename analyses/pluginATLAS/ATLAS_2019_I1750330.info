Description:
'Single- and double-differential cross-section measurements are presented for the production of top-quark pairs, 
in the lepton + jets channel at particle and parton level. Two topologies, resolved and boosted, are considered 
and the results are presented as a function of several kinematic variables characterising the top and the system 
and jet multiplicities. The study was performed using data from $pp$ collisions at centre-of-mass energy of 13 TeV 
collected in 2015 and 2016 by the ATLAS detector at the CERN Large Hadron Collider (LHC), corresponding to an integrated 
luminosity of 36 fb$^{-1}$. Due to the large $t\bar{t}$ cross-section at the LHC, such measurements allow a detailed study 
of the properties of top-quark production and decay, enabling precision tests of several Monte Carlo generators and 
fixed-order Standard Model predictions. Overall, there is good agreement between the theoretical predictions and the data.'
