Description:
  'Measurements of fiducial and differential cross sections of Higgs boson production in the $H\to ZZ^\ast\to 4\ell$ decay channel
  are presented. The cross sections are determined within a fiducial phase space and corrected for detection efficiency and resolution
  effects. They are based on 20.3 fb$^{-1}$ of $pp$ collision data, produced at $\sqrt{s}=8$ TeV centre-of-mass energy at the LHC and
  recorded by the ATLAS detector. The differential measurements are performed in bins of transverse momentum and rapidity of the
  four-lepton system, the invariant mass of the subleading lepton pair and the decay angle of the leading lepton pair with respect
  to the beam line in the four-lepton rest frame, as well as the number of jets and the transverse momentum of the leading jet.
  The measured cross sections are compared to selected theoretical calculations of the Standard Model expectations. No significant
  deviation from any of the tested predictions is found.'
