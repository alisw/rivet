Description:
  'The measurement of charged-particle event shape variables is presented in inclusive inelastic $pp$ collisions at a center-of-mass energy of
   7 TeV using the ATLAS detector at the LHC. The observables studied are the transverse thrust, thrust minor, and transverse sphericity,
   each defined using the final-state charged particles momentum components perpendicular to the beam direction.
   Events with at least six charged particles are selected by a minimum-bias trigger.
   In addition to the differential distributions, the evolution of each event shape variable as a function of
   the leading charged-particle transverse momentum, charged-particle multiplicity, and summed transverse momentum is presented.'
