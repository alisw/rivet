Description:
      'Abstract : 

	Measurements of the differential $\mathrm{t}\overline{\mathrm{t}}$ production cross section are presented in the single-lepton decay channel, with respect to a number of global event observables. The measurements are performed with $\text{35.9~fb}^{-1}$ of proton-proton collision data collected by the CMS experiment at the LHC during 2016 at $\sqrt{s} = \text{13~TeV}$. The differential cross sections are measured at the level of long-lived generated particles in a phase space similar to that accessible by the CMS detector, and are compared to state-of-the-art leading-order and next-to-leading-order $\mathrm{t}\overline{\mathrm{t}}$ simulations.

      Rivet : 

	  This analysis is to be run on ${\rm t\bar{t}}$ simulation. 

	  The particle level selection requires:
	  - exactly one electron or muon with $p_{T} > 26$~GeV and $|\eta| < 2.4$
	  - no additional electrons or muons with $p_{T} > 15$~GeV and $|\eta| < 2.4$
	  - at least thress jets with $p_{T} > 30$~GeV and $|\eta| < 2.4$, and one jet with $p_{T} > 25$~GeV and $|\eta| < 2.4$
	  - two of these selected jets must be tagged as originating from a b quark.
