Description:
 'The inclusive b-jet production cross section in pp collisions at a center-of-mass energy of 7 TeV is measured using data collected by the CMS experiment at the LHC. 
 The cross section is presented as a function of the jet transverse momentum in the range 18 $<$ pT $<$ 200 GeV for several rapidity intervals. 
 The results are also given as the ratio of the b-jet production cross section to the inclusive jet production cross section. 
 The measurement is performed with two different analyses, which differ in their trigger selection and b-jet identification: 
 a jet analysis that selects events with a b jet using a sample corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 34 inverse picobarns, 
 and a muon analysis requiring a b jet with a muon based on an integrated luminosity of 3 inverse picobarns. 
 In both approaches the b jets are identified by requiring a secondary vertex. 
 The results from the two methods are in agreement with each other and with next-to-leading order calculations, as well as with predictions 
 based on the PYTHIA event generator.'
