Description:
  'A measurement of the triple differential cross section in photon+jets final states 
  in $pp$ collisions at $\sqrt{s} = 7$ TeV.
  Photons with $|\eta|<2.5$ and $40$~GeV$<p_T<300$~GeV and 
  jets with $|\eta|<2.5$ and $p_T>30$ GeV are selected.
  The measurement uses 2.14 fb$^{-1}$ of integrated luminosity collected with the CMS detector.'
