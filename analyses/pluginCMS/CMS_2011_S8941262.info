Description:
  'A measurement of the $b$-hadron production cross-section in proton-proton
  collisions at $\sqrt{s} = 7$~TeV. The dataset, corresponding to 85
  inverse nanobarns, was recorded with the CMS experiment at the LHC using a
  low-threshold single-muon trigger. Events are selected by the presence of a
  muon with transverse momentum greater than 6 GeV with respect to the beam
  direction and pseudorapidity less than 2.1. The transverse momentum of the
  muon with respect to the closest jet discriminates events containing $b$ hadrons
  from background. The inclusive $b$-hadron production cross section is presented
  as a function of muon transverse momentum and pseudorapidity.'
