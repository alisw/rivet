Description:
  'A measurement of jet substructure observables is presented using $t\bar{t}$ events in the lepton+jets channel
  from proton-proton collisions at $\sqrt{s}=13$ TeV recorded by the CMS experiment at the LHC, corresponding to
  an integrated luminosity of 35.9/fb. Multiple jet substructure observables are measured for jets identified as
  bottom, light-quark, and gluon jets, as well as for inclusive jets (no flavor information). The results are
  unfolded to the particle level and compared to next-to-leading-order predictions from POWHEG interfaced with
  the parton shower generators PYTHIA 8 and HERWIG 7, as well as from SHERPA 2 and DIRE 2. A value of the strong
  coupling at the Z boson mass, $\alpha_{S}(m_{Z}) = 0.115^{+0.015}_{-0.013}$, is extracted from the substructure
  data at leading-order plus leading-log accuracy.'
