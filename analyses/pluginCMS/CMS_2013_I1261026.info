Description:
  'Characteristics of multi-particle production in proton-proton
  collisions at $\sqrt{s} = 7$ TeV are studied as a function of the
  charged-particle multiplicity ($N_\text{ch}$). The produced particles are separated
  into two classes: those belonging to jets and those belonging to the
  underlying event. Charged particles are measured with pseudorapidity
  $|\eta| < 2.4$ and transverse momentum $p_\text{T} > 0.25$ GeV. Jets are
  reconstructed from charged-particles only and required to have
  $p_\text{T} > 5$ GeV. The distributions of jet $p_\text{T}$, average $p_\text{T}$ of charged particles
  belonging to the underlying event or to jets, jet rates, and jet shapes
  are presented as functions of $N_\text{ch}$.'
