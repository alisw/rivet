Description:
  'The first evidence of events consistent with the production of a single top
  quark in association with a photon is reported. The analysis is based on
  proton-proton collisions at s=13  TeV and recorded by the CMS experiment in
  2016, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 35.9  fb-1. Events are
  selected by requiring the presence of a muon, a photon, an imbalance
  in transverse momentum from an undetected neutrino, and at least two jets
  of which exactly one is identified as associated with the hadronization of
  a b quark. A multivariate discriminant based on topological and kinematic
  event properties is employed to separate signal from background processes. An
  excess above the background-only hypothesis is observed, with a significance
  of 4.4 standard deviations. A fiducial cross section is measured for isolated
  photons with transverse momentum greater than 25 GeV in the central region of
  the detector. The measured product of the cross section and branching fraction
  is $115 \pm 17 \text{ (stat)} \pm 30 \text{ (syst)}~\mathrm{fb}$, consistent with the
  Standard Model prediction.

  Warning: the fiducial definition in this analysis relies on generation-level cuts
  and cannot be exactly reproduced.'
