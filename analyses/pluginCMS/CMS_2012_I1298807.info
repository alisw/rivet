Description:
  'A measurement of the inclusive $ZZ$ production cross section and constraints on anomalous triple gauge
  couplings in proton-proton collisions at $\sqrt{s} = 8 TeV$ are presented. The analysis is based on a
  data sample, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 19.6/fb, collected with the CMS experiment
  at the LHC. The measurements are performed in the leptonic decay modes $ZZ \to lll^\prime l^\prime$, where $l = e,\mu$
  and $l^\prime = e, \mu, \tau$. The measured total cross section $ \sigma (pp \to ZZ) = 7.7 \pm 0.5~(\mathrm{stat})
  + 0.5 -0.4~(\mathrm{syst}) \pm 0.4~(\mathrm{theo}) \pm 0.2~(\mathrm{lumi})~pb$, for both $Z$ bosons
  produced in the mass range $60 < m_Z < 120 \GeV$, is consistent with standard model predictions.
  Differential cross sections, in phase space $p_T(\mu) > 5 \GeV$, $p_T(e) > 7 \GeV$, $|\eta(\mu)|<2.4$ ,
  $|\eta(e)|<2.5$ and the 60--120~\GeV mass requirement, are measured and well described by the
  theoretical predictions. The invariant mass distribution of the four-lepton system is used to set
  limits on anomalous $ZZZ$ and $ZZ\gamma$ couplings at the 95\% confidence level, $-0.004 < f4Z < 0.004$,
  $-0.004 < f5Z < 0.004$, $-0.005 < f4\gamma < 0.005$, and $-0.005 < f5\gamma < 0.005.$'
