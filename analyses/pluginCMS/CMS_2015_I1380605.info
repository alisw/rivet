Description:
  'The per-event yield of the highest transverse momentum charged particle and
  charged-particle jet, integrated
   above a given $p_{T\;min}$  threshold starting at $p_{T\;min}=0.8$ and $1$~GeV,
   respectively, is studied in $pp$ collisions at $\sqrt{s} = 8$~\TeV.
   The particles and the jets are measured in the pseudorapidity ranges
   $|\eta| < 2.4$ and $1.9$, respectively.'
