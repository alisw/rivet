Description:
      "A measurement of the underlying event (UE) activity is performed in proton-proton
      collisions at the centre-of-mass energy of 13 TeV with the CMS experiment at the
      LHC. The measurement is performed using leading charged-particles as well as lead-
      ing charged-particle jets as reference objects. A leading charged-particle or charged-
      particle jet is required to be produced in the central pseudorapidity region ( |eta| < 2)
      jet and with transverse momentum pT greater than 0.5 (pT greater than 1) GeV for leading charged-particle
      (charge particle jet). The UE activity is measured in terms of the average multiplicity
      and scalar sum of pT of the charged-particles, in the azimuthal region transverse 
      to the direction of the leading reference object."
