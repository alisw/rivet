RunInfo: 'Run MC generators with Z decaying leptonically into both electrons and muons at 8 TeV CoM energy.
For jet-flavour inclusive samples, order of 20 million unweighted events can give a reasonable global comparison,
but precision in the high jet multiplicity region/high jet pt may require substantially larger samples or statistical
enhancement of high jet multiplicities.'

Description:
'Measurements of the associated production of a Z boson with at least
one jet originating from a b quark in proton-proton collisions
at $\sqrt{s} = 8$ TeV are presented. Differential cross sections are
measured with data collected by the CMS experiment corresponding to an
integrated luminosity of 19.8 $\text{fb}^{-1}$. Z bosons are reconstructed
through their decays to electrons and muons. Cross sections are
measured as a function of observables characterizing the kinematics of
the b jet and the Z boson. Ratios of differential cross
sections for the associated production with at least one b jet
to the associated production with any jet are also presented.  The
production of a Z boson with at least two b jets is investigated,
and differential cross sections are measured for the dijet system.
Results are compared to theoretical predictions, testing two different
flavour schemes for the choice of initial-state partons. Note of the authors:
the Z boson selection and b-tagging algorithms used in the code are based on
standard Rivet code and do not exactly coincide with those used in the paper.
They anyway reproduce the paper results at the percent level or better for most
of the bins.'
