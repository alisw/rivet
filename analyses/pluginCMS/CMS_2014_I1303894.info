RunInfo:
   Run MC generators with $W$ decaying leptonically at 7 TeV CoM energy. A large number of
    events are required to populate the high jet multiplicity region. Suitable results can
    be achieved with 85M events.
Beams: [p+, p+]
Energies: [7000]
PtCuts:
  Leading muon $pT > 25 GeV$ and leading muon $|eta| < 2.1$
  Jet $pT > 30 GeV$ and $|eta| < 2.4$
Description:
  A study of jet production in association with $W$ bosons has been performed, in
  events with the $W$ decaying to a muon. Jets are required to have $pT > 30$ GeV and $|eta| < 2.4$.
  Muons are required to have $pT > 25$ and $|eta| < 2.1$. Jets are only considered if they are
  separated from the muon by $\Delta{R} > 0.5$. Muons are dressed with photons in a cone of $0.1$
  around the muon.
