Description:
	'The top-quark pair differential production cross section in $pp$ collisions at
    $\sqrt{s}=8~\TeV$ as a function of the number of jets is measured in the
    lepton+jets (e/mu+jets) final state for an integrated luminosity of 19.7/fb.
    The cross section is presented in the visible phase space of the measurement.'
