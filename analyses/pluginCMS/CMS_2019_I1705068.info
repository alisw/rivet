Description:
  'Measurements are presented of associated production of a W boson and a charm quark (W+c) in proton-proton collisions at a center-of-mass energy of 13 TeV. The data correspond to an integrated luminosity of $35.7 fb^{-1}$ collected by the CMS experiment at the CERN LHC. The W bosons are identified by their decay into a muon and a neutrino. The charm quarks are tagged via the full reconstruction of $D*(2010)^{\pm}$ mesons that decay via $D*(2010)^{\pm} \to D^{0} + \pi^{pm} \to K^{\mp} + \pi^{pm} + \pi^{pm}$.
  A parton-level cross section is measured in the fiducial region defined by the muon transverse momentum $\p_{T}^{\mu} > 26 GeV$, muon pseudorapidity $\abs{\eta^{\mu}} < 2.4$, and charm quark transverse momentum $p_{T}^{c} > 5\GeV$.
  The cross section is also measured differentially as a function of the pseudorapidity of the muon from the W boson decay.
  A particle-level cross section is measured in the fiducial region defined by the muon transverse momentum $\p_{T}^{\mu} > 26 GeV$, muon pseudorapidity $\abs{\eta^{\mu}} < 2.4$, D*(2010)^{\pm} transverse momentum $p_{T}^{D*} > 5\GeV$ and D*(2010)^{\pm} pseudorapidity $\abs{\eta^{D*}} < 2.4$. The particle-level cross section has been implemented in the Rivet plugin.'
