  These cross sections are given for the fiducial region defined as follows
  - Leading muon $p_T > 31$ GeV and abs(eta) < 2.4
  - Trailing muon $p_T > 9$ GeV and abs(eta) < 2.4
  - Photon $p_T > 5$ GeV
  - Photon abs(eta) < 2.4 but not 1.4 < abs(eta) < 1.6
  - Separation between photon and closest muon 0.05 < DeltaR < 3.0
  - Di-muon invariant mass 30 < M_mumu < 87 GeV

Description:
  'The differential cross sections for the production of photons in Z to mu+ mu-
  gamma decays are presented as a function of the transverse energy of the
  photon and its separation from the nearest muon. The data for these
  measurements were collected with the CMS detector and correspond to an
  integrated luminosity of 4.7 inverse femtobarns of pp collisions at sqrt(s) =
  7 TeV delivered by the CERN LHC.'
