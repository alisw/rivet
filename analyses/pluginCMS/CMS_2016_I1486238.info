Description:
   'Measurements are presented of the cross section for the production of at
    least four jets, of which at least two originate from $b$ quarks, in
    proton-proton collisions. Data collected with the CMS detector at the LHC at
    a center-of-mass energy of 7 TeV are used, corresponding to an integrated
    luminosity of 3 inverse picobarns. The cross section is measured as a
    function of the jet transverse momentum for \pT 20 GeV, and of the jet
    pseudorapidity for $|\eta|<2.4$ ($b$ jets) and 4.7 (untagged jets). The
    correlations in azimuthal angle and \pT between the jets are also
    studied. The $\eta$ and \pT distributions of the four jets and the correlations
    between them are well reproduced by event generators that combine
    perturbative QCD calculations at next-to-leading-order accuracy with
    contributions from parton showers and multiparton interactions.'
