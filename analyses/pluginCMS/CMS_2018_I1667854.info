Description:
  'The production of a Z boson, decaying to two charged leptons, in association with jets in proton-proton
  collisions at a centre-of-mass energy of 13 TeV is measured. Data recorded with the CMS detector at the
  LHC are used that correspond to an integrated luminosity of 2.19$\,$fb$^{-1}$. The cross section is measured
  as a function of the jet multiplicity and its dependence on the transverse momentum of the Z boson, the jet
  kinematic variables (transverse momentum and rapidity), the scalar sum of the jet momenta, which quantifies
  the hadronic activity, and the balance in transverse momentum between the reconstructed jet recoil and the
  Z boson. The measurements are compared with predictions from four different calculations. The first two
  merge matrix elements with different parton multiplicities in the final state and parton showering, one
  of which includes one-loop corrections. The third is a fixed-order calculation with next-to-next-to-leading
  order accuracy for the process with a Z boson and one parton in the final state. The fourth combines the
  fully differential next-to-next-to-leading order calculation with next-to-next-to-leading logarithm
  resummation and parton showering.'
