Description:
   Measurement of the underlying event activity, in proton-proton collisions at a centre-of-mass
   energy of $13~\mathrm{TeV}$, performed using inclusive Z-boson events collected by the CMS
   experiment at the Large Hadron Collider. The analyzed data corresponds to an integrated
   luminosity of $2.1~\mathrm{fb}^{-1}$. The underlying event activity is quantified in terms
   of charged particle multiplicity and their scalar sum of their transverse momentum in
   different topological regions defined with respect to the resultatnt azimuthal direction
   of the two muons coming from the decay of a Z-boson. The distributions are unfolded to
   stable charged-particle level and are compared with predictions from various simulations,
   as well as with the measurements at a centre-of-mass energy of $1.96~\mathrm{TeV}$ and
   $7~\mathrm{TeV}$ by the CDF and CMS experiments.
