Description:
  'Fully leptonic $WZ$ diboson production at the CMS experiment, measured inclusively at
   7 and 8~TeV, and differentially at 8 TeV only (this analysis). The differential
   cross-sections are measured with respect to $Z$ $p_T$, leading jet $p_T$, and the
   jet multiplicity. This data is useful for constraining MC models of QCD and EW activity
   in diboson events, and for constraining anomalous couplings.'
