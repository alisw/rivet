Description:
'A measurement for inclusive 2- and 3-jet events of the azimuthal correlation between 
the two jets with the largest transverse momenta, $\Delta\phi_{12}$, is presented. The measurement 
considers events where the two leading jets are nearly collinear ("back-to-back") 
in the transverse plane and is performed for several ranges of the leading
jet transverse momentum. Proton-proton collision data collected with the CMS experiment 
at a center-of-mass energy of 13 TeV and corresponding to an integrated
luminosity of 35.9 $\text{fb}^{-1}$ are used.'
