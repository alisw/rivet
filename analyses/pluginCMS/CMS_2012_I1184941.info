RunInfo:
   High statistics is needed to observe events in the lowest (xi) bin.
   Distributions are presented for hard QCD events (i.e. with $\hat{\pT}$ greater than
   15 GeV) and diffractive-enhanced events.

Description:
   Measurement of the differential cross section for inclusive dijet production as a function of $\xi$
   which approximates the fractional momentum loss of the scattered proton in single-diffraction events. The
   data used has a total integrated luminosity of 2.7 nb$^{-1}$ collected during 2010 with low instantaneous luminosity.
   Events are selected with at least two jets in $|\eta| < 4.4$ with $\pT > 20$ GeV and all final states particles
   are used for the reconstruction of $\xi$.
