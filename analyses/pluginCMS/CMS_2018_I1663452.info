Description:
  'Dijet angular distributions are measured in proton-proton collisions at sqrt(s)=13 TeV using based on a data set corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 35.9/fb collected by the CMS detector at the CERN LHC. Dijet angular distributions are found to be in agreement with the perturbative QCD predictions that include electroweak corrections.'
