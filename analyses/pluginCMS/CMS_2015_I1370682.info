Description:
  'The reconstruction of particle-level top quarks and anti-quarks is implemented in this module.
  Measurements at $\sqrt{s} = 8~\TeV$ are based on parton-level information in the full phase
  space using MADGRAPH+PYTHIA6. To match the particle-level top quark distributions to the
  measurements unfolded to the parton-level, a correction function to the particle-level
  distributions, derived using the same MADGRAPH+PYTHIA6 configuration that was used for the
  original measurement of the data points, is applied.  Using the same MC configuration as used
  for the unfolding to correct back the parton-level to particle-level, the model dependence
  introduced in unfolding to parton-level and extrapolating the measurement to the full phase
  space is eliminated. See the paper for full object selection and correction details.'
