Description:
  'Measurements are presented of event shapes and azimuthal correlations in the
  inclusive production of a Z boson in association with jets in proton-proton collisions. The
  data correspond to an integrated luminosity of 5.0/fb, collected with the CMS detector
  at the CERN LHC at $\sqrt{s} = 7$\;TeV. This to test perturbative QCD predictions
  and evaluate a substantial background to most physics channels. Studies performed
  as a function of jet multiplicity for inclusive $Z$ boson production and for $Z$ bosons with
  transverse-momenta greater than 150\;GeV, are compared to predictions from Monte
  Carlo event generators that include leading-order multiparton matrix-element (with
  up to four hard partons in the final state) and next-to-leading-order simulations of
  Z + 1-jet events. The results are corrected for detector effects, and can therefore be
  used as input to improve models for describing these processes.'
