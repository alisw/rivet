Description:
  'A measurement of the double-differential inclusive jet cross section as a function of
  jet transverse momentum pT and absolute jet rapidity |y| is presented. The analysis is
  based on proton-proton collisions collected by the CMS experiment at the LHC at a
  centre-of-mass energy of 13 TeV. The data samples correspond to integrated luminosities
  of 71 and 44 pb-1 for |y| < 3 and 3.2 < |y| < 4.7, respectively. Jets are reconstructed
  with the anti-kt clustering algorithm for two jet sizes, R, of 0.7 and 0.4, in a phase
  space region covering jet pT up to 2 TeV and jet rapidity up to |y| = 4.7. Predictions
  of perturbative quantum chromodynamics at next-to-leading order precision, complemented
  with electroweak and nonperturbative corrections, are used to compute the absolute scale
  and the shape of the inclusive jet cross section. The cross-section difference in $R$,
  when going to a smaller jet size of 0.4, is best described by Monte Carlo event generators
  with next-to-leading order predictions matched to parton showering, hadronisation, and
  multiparton interactions. In the phase space accessible with the new data, this
  measurement provides a first indication that jet physics is as well understood at
  $\sqrt(s) = 13\;\TeV$ as at smaller centre-of-mass energies.'
