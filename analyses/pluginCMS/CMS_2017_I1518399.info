Description:
 'Measurement of the differential and normalised differential $t\bar{t}$ production cross
 section as a function of the leading jet mass. The measurement was performed in the lepton+jets channel
 and the fiducial measurement phase space is enriched with events where the leading jet includes all
 decay products of a hadronically decaying top quark.

 This analysis is to be run on ${t\bar{t}}$ simulation.

  The objects are defined as follows
  - Lepton: electron or muon originating from the decay of a W boson
  - Jets: jets are clustered from final state particles using the Cambridge-Aachen algorithm
    with a distance parameter of 1.2. If a lepton overlaps with a jet (distance in the
    eta-phi plane smaller 1.2) its four momentum is subtracted from the four momentum of the jet.

  Definition of the particle level phase space:
  - only ${\rm t\bar{t}}$ decays with one top quark decaying hadronically and one top quark
    decaying leptonically including an electron or muon from the W decay.
  - lepton $\pt > 45\;\GeV$ and $|\eta| < 2.1$
  - at least one jet with $\pt > 400\;\GeV$ and $|\eta| < 2.5$
  - a second jet with $\pt > 150\;\GeV$ and $|\eta| < 2.5$
  - veto on additional jets with $\pt > 150\;\GeV$ and $|\eta| < 2.5$
  - distance between the second jet and the lepton in the eta-phi plane $\Delta R(jet2, lepton)$ smaller 1.2
  - invariant mass of the leading jet larger than the invariant mass of the combination of the second jet and lepton

  The differential and normalised differential cross section was measured as a function of the leading jet mass.'
