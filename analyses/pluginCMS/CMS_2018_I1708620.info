Description:
  'A measurement of the energy density in proton-proton collisions at a
  centre-of-mass energy of $\sqrt{s} = 13$ TeV is presented.  The data have been
  recorded with the CMS experiment at the LHC during low luminosity operations in
  2015. The energy density is studied as a function of pseudorapidity in the
  ranges $-6.6 < \eta < -5.2$ and $3.15 < |\eta| < 5.20$. The results are compared
  with the predictions of several models. All the models considered suggest a
  different shape of the pseudorapidity dependence compared to that observed in
  the data.  A comparison with LHC proton-proton collision data at $\sqrt{s} =
  0.9$ and 7 TeV confirms the compatibility of the data with the hypothesis of
  limiting fragmentation.'
