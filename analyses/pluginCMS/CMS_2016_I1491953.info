Description:
  'Differential cross sections for a W boson produced in association with jets are measured in a data sample of proton-proton collisions at a center-of-mass energy of 8 TeV recorded with the CMS detector and corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 19.6 inverse femtobarns. The W bosons are identified through their decay into a muon and a neutrino. The cross sections are reported as functions of jet multiplicity, jet transverse momenta, and the scalar sum of jet transverse momenta ($H_T$) for different jet multiplicities. Distributions of the angular correlations between the jets and the muon are examined, as well as the average number of jets as a function of $H_T$ and as a function of angular variables. The cross sections are measured in the fiducial region defined by a muon with $p_T > 25$ GeV and pseudorapidity $|\eta| < 2.1$, and by a transverse mass between the muon and the missing transverse energy $M_T > 50$ GeV. Jets are reconstructed using the anti-kT algorithm with a distance parameter R = 0.5, and only jets with $p_T > 30$ GeV, $|\eta| < 2.4$, and a separation of $\Delta R > 0.5$ from the muon are considered.'
