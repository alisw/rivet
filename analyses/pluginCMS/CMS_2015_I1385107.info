Description:
  'A measurement of the underlying event (UE) activity in proton-proton collisions
   is performed using events with charged-particle jets produced in the central pseudorapidity
   region ($|\eta|^\text{jet} < 2$)  and with transverse momentum $1 \leq p_T^\text{jet} < 100$~\GeV.
   The analysis uses a data sample collected at a centre-of-mass energy of 2.76~\TeV with the CMS experiment at the LHC.
   The UE activity is measured as a function of $p_T^\text{jet}$ in terms of the average multiplicity and
   scalar sum of transverse momenta of charged particles, with $|\eta| < 2$ and $p_T > 0.5$~\GeV,
   in the azimuthal region transverse to the highest-$p_T$ jet direction.
   By further dividing the transverse region into two regions of smaller and larger activity,
   various components of the UE activity are separated.'
