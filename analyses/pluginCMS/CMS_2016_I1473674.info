  ttbar events at sqrt(s) = 8 TeV (inclusive or lepton+jets decay mode)
  Top quarks are expected in the event record to identify the decay mode.

Description:
  'Measurements are reported of the normalized differential cross sections for top quark pair production with respect to four kinematic event variables: the missing transverse energy; the scalar sum of the jet transverse momentum (pT); the scalar sum of the pT of all objects in the event; and the pT of leptonically decaying W bosons from top quark decays.'
