Description:
  'Charged particle distributions in different final states at $\sqrt{s} = 13$~TeV by the CMS experiment.
   Pseudorapidity, multiplicity and transverse momentum distributions of all charged particles.
   Also the $\pT$ leading charged particle spectrum and its integration as function of $\pT$.
   The distributions are presented for inelastic, non-single-diffractive
   and single-diffractive event selections.
   Please note, that the MC predictions are not scaled to the datapoints,
   in contrast to Figure 6 in the publication.'
