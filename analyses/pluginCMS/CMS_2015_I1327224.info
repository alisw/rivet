Description:
   'A search is presented for quark contact interactions and extra spatial dimensions in proton-proton collisions at sqrt(s) = 8 TeV
    using dijet angular distributions. The search is based on a data set corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 19.7 fb-1
    collected by the CMS detector at the CERN LHC. Dijet angular distributions are found to be in agreement with the perturbative
    QCD predictions that include electroweak corrections. Limits on the contact interaction scale from a variety of models at
    next-to-leading order in QCD corrections are obtained. A benchmark model in which only left-handed quarks participate is excluded
    up to a scale of 9.0 (11.7) TeV for destructive (constructive) interference at 95% confidence level. Lower limits between 6.0 and
    8.4 TeV on the scale of virtual graviton exchange are extracted for the Arkani-Hamed--Dimopoulos--Dvali model of extra spatial dimensions.'
