Description:
  'Jet charge is an estimator of the electric charge of a quark, antiquark, or gluon initiating a jet. It is based on the momentum-weighted sum of the electric charges of the jet constituents. Measurements of three charge observables of the leading jet in transverse momentum $p_\mathrm{T}$ are performed with dijet events. The analysis is carried out with data collected by the CMS experiment at the CERN LHC in proton-proton collisions at $\sqrt{s}=8\TeV$ corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 19.7 fb$^{-1}$. The results are presented in bins of the $p_\mathrm{T}$ of the leading jet.'
