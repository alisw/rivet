Description:
   'The inelastic cross-section is measured through two independent methods
    based on information from (i) forward calorimetry (for pseudorapidity
    $3 < |\eta| < 5$), in collisions where at least one proton loses more than
    $\xi > 5 \cdot 10^{-6}$ of its longitudinal momentum, and (ii) the central
    tracker ($|\eta| < 2.4$), in collisions containing an interaction vertex
    with more than 1, 2, or 3 tracks with $p_\perp > 200\;\MeV/c$.'
