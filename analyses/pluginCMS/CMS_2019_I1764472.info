Description:
  'A measurement of the ttbar production cross section as a function of the jet mass of hadronic decays of boosted top quarks is presented.
  The measurement is carried out in the lepton+jets channel.
  As leptons, muons and electrons are defined with originate from the W boson decay.
  Jets are clustered from all stable particles excluding neutrinos in a two-step procedure using the XCone algorithm.
  At first, two large jets (R=1.2) are found aiming at a reconstruction of the two top quarks.
  Using the constituents of those jets, XCone is run again finding three subjets with R=0.4.
  A jet representing the hadronic and leptonic top quark decay is found by the angular distance to the leading lepton in the event.
  The final jets are constructed as the sum of the subjet four-momenta.
  The jet identified as the one containing the hadronic top quark decay is required to have \pt > 400 GeV.
  Furthermore, the jet mass of this jet has to be larger than the invariant mass of the combined system of second jet and lepton.
  Both, the differential and normalized differential ttbar production cross sections are measured as a function of the jet mass.
