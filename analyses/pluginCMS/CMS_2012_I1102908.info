Description:
   This is a measurement of the ratio of inclusive to exclusive
   dijet production as a function of the absolute distance in
   rapidity, $\Delta y$, between jets. The ratio of the
   Mueller-Navelet to exclusive dijet production is also
   measured.  These measurements were performed with the CMS
   detector in proton-proton collisions at $\sqrt{s} = 7$ TeV for
   jets with $p_T > 35$ GeV and $|y| < 4.7$ taken from a mixture
   of two data samples, one of which containing dijets with
   moderate rapidity separation and the other containing dijets
   with large rapidity separation, with integrated luminosity of
   33/nb and 5/pb respectively. The measured observables are
   corrected for detector effects.
