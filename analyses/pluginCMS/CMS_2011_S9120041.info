Description:
   A measurement of the underlying activity in scattering processes with a hard
   scale in the several-GeV region is performed in proton-proton collisions at
   Energies of 0.9 and 7\;TeV, using data collected by the CMS experiment at the
   LHC. The production of charged particles with pseudorapidity |eta| < 2 and
   transverse momentum $\pT > 0.5$\;GeV/$c$ is studied in the azimuthal region transverse
   to that of the leading set of charged particles forming a track-jet. Various
   comparisons are made between the two different energies and also beteen two
   sets of cuts on \pT for leading track jet \pT-leading $> 3$\;GeV and pT-leading $> 20$\;GeV.
   The activity is studied using 5 types of plots. Two profile plots for the
   multiplicity of charged particles and the scalar sum of \pT. and three distributions
   for the two previous quantities as well as \pT for all the particles in the
   transverse region.
