Description:
  'Measurements of the differential jet cross section are presented as a function
   of jet mass in dijet events, in bins of jet transverse momentum, with and without
   a jet grooming algorithm. The data have been recorded by the CMS Collaboration
   in proton-proton collisions at the LHC at a center-of-mass energy of 13\TeV and
   correspond to an integrated luminosity of 2.3\fbinv.
   The absolute cross sections show slightly different jet
   transverse momentum spectra in data and Monte Carlo event generators
   for the settings used. Removing this transverse momentum dependence,
   the normalized cross section for ungroomed jets is consistent with the
   prediction from Monte Carlo event generators for masses below 30\% of
   the transverse momentum. The normalized cross section for groomed jets
   is measured with higher precision than the ungroomed cross
   section. Semi-analytical calculations of the jet mass beyond leading
   logarithmic accuracy are compared to data, as well as predictions at
   leading order and next-to-leading order, which include parton
   showering and hadronization. Overall, in the normalized cross section,
   the theoretical predictions agree with the measured cross sections
   within the uncertainties for masses from 10 to 30\% of the jet
   transverse momentum.'
