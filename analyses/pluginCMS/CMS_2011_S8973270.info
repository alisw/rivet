RunInfo:
   Inclusive QCD at 7 TeV. A $\hat{\pT}$ cut (or similar) is recommended since
   a leading jet $\pT > 56$ GeV is required.

Description: 'The differential $B\bar{B}$ cross-section is measured as a function of the opening angle $\Delta{R}$ and $\Delta\phi$
   using data collected with the CMS detector during 2010 and corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 3.1 pb$^{-1}$.
   The measurement is performed for three different event energy scales, characterized by the transverse momentum of the
   leading jet in the event (above 56 GeV, above 84 GeV and above 120 GeV). Simulated events are normalised in the region
   $\Delta{R} > 2.4$ and $\Delta\phi > 3/4\pi$ respectively.'
