Description: Analysis of $\Xi_c^0$ production in B decays and from the $c\bar{c}$ continuum, with the $\Xi_c^0$
  decaying into $\Omega^- K^+$ and $\Xi^- \pi^+$ final states measured using 116.1 $\text{fb}^{-1}$ of data
  collected by the BABAR detector.
  The normalisation of the data as been modifed from that presented in the original paper in order
  to produce a differential cross section rather than the cross section in each bin. In addition to the data
  presented in the paper plots are alos made with unit normalisation which can be more useful for
  Monte Carlo tuning.
