Description:
  'Unfolded measurement of recoil w, helicity and decay plane angles of semileptonc B0bar to D*+ decays. The data was used to determine Vcb. Note that the data in the paper does not account for the bin wodths. The data shipped with rivet is divided by the bin width and all curves are normalised to the partial width of B0bar-> D*+ ell nu'
