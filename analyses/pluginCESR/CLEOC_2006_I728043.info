Description:
'Measurement of the inclusive branching ratios for  $\eta$, $\eta^\prime$ and $\phi$
production in $D^0$, $D^+$ and $D_s^+$ decays. In addition the spectra for $\eta$ and $\phi$ production are also measured, in the CMS frame of the collision. N.B. The spetral information was really intended as part of the analysis to measure the inclusive brnaching ratios, not as a measurement, and therefore shoud be used with care. However there are few distrubtions available for D decays and therefore the spectra are still useful.'
