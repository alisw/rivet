Description:
  Analysis of charm quark fragmentation at 10.5 GeV, based on a data
  sample of 103 fb collected by the CLEO experiment. 
  Fragmentation into $D^\pm_s$ and $D^{*\pm}_s$ mesons is studied.
  This analysis can be used to constrain charm fragmentation 
  in Monte Carlo generators. The branching ratios $\text{B}_1=B(D^{*+}_s\to D_s^+\gamma)B(D_s^+\to\phi\pi^+)B(\phi\to K^+K^-)$
  and $B_2=B(D_s^+\to\phi\pi^+)B(\phi\to K^+K^-)$, are not unfolded.
