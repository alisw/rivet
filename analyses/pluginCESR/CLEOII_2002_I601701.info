Summary: Spectra of $\eta^\prime$ mesons in $\Upsilon(1S)$ decays
Experiment: CLEO-II
Collider: CESR
InspireID: 601701
Status: VALIDATED
Authors:
 - Peter Richardson <Peter.Richardson@durham.ac.uk>
References:
 - Phys.Rev. D67 (2003) 052003
RunInfo:
  Any process producing Upslion 1S, original $e^+ e^-$
Description:
  Measurement of the inclusive production of the $\eta^\prime$ mesons in $\Upsilon(1S)$ decays by the CLEO-II experiment.
  In principle this measurement is superseeded, however the newer result (CLEOIII_2006_I728679) did not include numerical values which were read from the plots and therefore we keep this measurement.
ValidationInfo:
  'Herwig events with Upsilon(1S) decays.'
