Description:
  Analysis of charm quark fragmentation at 10.5 GeV, based on a data
  sample of 103 fb collected by the CLEO experiment. 
  Fragmentation into charm is studied for the charmed hadron ground states, 
  namely $D^0$, $D^+$, as well as the excited states 
  $D^{*0}$ and $D^{*+}$. This analysis can be used to constrain charm fragmentation 
  in Monte Carlo generators.
