RunInfo: Inclusive differential production cross section of forward photons produced in p-p collisions at $\mathrm{\sqrt{s}=13\,TeV}$. Cross section is expressed as a function of energy in two different pseudorapidity regions, namely $\eta>10.94$ and $8.81<\eta<8.99$. The measurements refer to all photons directly produced in the collisions or resulting from the decay of short life particles ($\mathrm{c \tau<1\,cm}$).

Description:
  'In this paper, we report the production cross-section of forward photons in the pseudorapidity regions of $\eta>10.94$ and $8.99>\eta>8.81$, measured by the LHCf experiment with proton-proton collisions at $\mathrm{\sqrt{s}=13\,TeV}$. The results from the analysis of $\mathrm{0.191\,nb^{-1}}$ of data obtained in June 2015 are compared to the predictions of several hadronic interaction models that are used in air-shower simulations for ultra-high-energy cosmic rays. Although none of the models agree perfectly with the data, EPOS-LHC shows the best agreement with the experimental data among the models.'
