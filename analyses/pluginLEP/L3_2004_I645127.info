Description:
  'Measurement of $e^+e^-\to e^+e^-\gamma\gamma\to e^+e^-\to e^+e^-\mu^+\mu^-,\ \tau^+\tau^-$.
   This analysis can test approximations used to simulate this process, but also is a prototype for analyses of $\gamma\gamma$ collisions.
   There are two modes supported, the first PROCESS=EE, simulates for full process starting with $e^+e^-$ beams, while the second
   PROCESS=GG is the extracted cross section for $\gamma\gamma\to \mu^+\mu^-$.'
