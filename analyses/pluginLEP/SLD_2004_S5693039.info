Description: Measurements of the differential production rates of stable charged particles in hadronic $Z^0$ decays, and of charged pions,
   kaons and protons identified over a wide momentum range. In addition to flavour-inclusive $Z^0$ decays, measurements are made for $Z^0$
   decays into light ($u$, $d$, $s$), $c$ and $b$ primary flavors.
