  For quark fragmentation $e^+e^-\to q\bar{q}$ events are required, while for gluon fragmentation
  the fictonal $e^+e^-\to gg$ process is required.

Description:
  Measurement of the fragmentation functions for quarks and gluons at LEP. Useful for studying the properties
  of gluon jets and the differences between quark and gluon jets. For the study of gluon jets the fictional
  $e^+e^-\to g g $ process must be used. The data in histograms labelled "hemisphere fragmentation" are measured
  from jets defined by hemispheres, with an energy scale defined by $E=\sqrt{s}/2$,
  while data in histograms named "durham fragmentation" are measured from jets defined by the durham algorithm
  with $Q_\mathrm{jet}=E_\mathrm{jet}\sin(\theta/2)$ as the energy scale. The rivet analysis defines the jet
  flavour from the initial quarks, as the data are corrected for impurities, and defines all jets as
  hemispheres with energy scale $E=\sqrt{s}/2$.
