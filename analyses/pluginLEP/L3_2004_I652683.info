Description: 'Event shapes, charged particle multiplicity and scaled momentum distributions, flavour separated
             at the Z-boson peak. The analysis also includes non-flavour separated
	     event shapes, charged particle multiplicity and scaled momentum distributions at events both above and
	     below the Z pole. There are also jet distributions in the paper which are not currently implemented.
             Beam energy must be specified as analysis option "ENERGY" when rivet-merging samples.'
