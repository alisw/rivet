  'ppbar events. Non-single diffractive events need to be switched on.
  The trigger implementation is the same as in UA5_1989_S1926373.
  Important: Only the correlation strengths with symmetric eta bins
  should be used for tuning. Beam energy must be specified as analysis option "ENERGY"
  (200, 546 or 900 GeV) when rivet-merging samples.'

Description:
  'Data on two-particle pseudorapidity and multiplicity correlations
  of charged particles for non single-diffractive $p\\bar{p}$ collisions at
  c.m. energies of 200, 546 and 900~GeV. Pseudorapidity correlations are interpreted
  in terms of a cluster model, which has been motivated by this and other
  experiments, require on average about two charged particles per cluster.
  The decay width of the clusters in pseudorapidity is approximately independent
  of multiplicity and of c.m. energy. The investigations of correlations in terms
  of pseudorapidity gaps confirm the picture of cluster production. The strength
  of forward--backward multiplicity correlations increases linearly with ins and
  depends strongly on position and size of the pseudorapidity gap separating
  the forward and backward interval. All our correlation studies can be understood
  in terms of a cluster model in which clusters contain on average about two
  charged particles, i.e. are of similar magnitude to earlier estimates from the ISR.
  Beam energy must be specified as analysis option "ENERGY" (200, 546 or 900 GeV) when 
  rivet-merging samples.'
