Description:
  WARNING - implemented to the best of abilities, no theory curve in the
  publication to compare to.
  Charged multiplicities are measured at $\sqrt{s} = 30.4$, 44.5, 52.2
  and 62.2 GeV using a minimum-bias trigger. The data is sub-divided
  into inelastic as well as non-single-diffractive events.
