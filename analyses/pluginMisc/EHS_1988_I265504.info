Description:
  'Measurement of charged particle production spectra in longitudinal and transverse momentum
  as well as rapidity by the EHS/NA22 collaboration at the SPS. Experiment was done with a
  fixed hydrogen target and beams of $p$, $\pi^+$ and $K^+$ with $250\,\GeV/c$. Measured spectra
  are for positively charged hadrons $C^+$ and negative charge pions $\pi^-$. $C^+$ excludes
  slow protons with $p < 1.2\,\GeV/c$ in the laboratory. Final spectra are in center-of-mass
  variables: $x_\mathrm{F}$, $y$ and $p_\mathrm{T}$.'
