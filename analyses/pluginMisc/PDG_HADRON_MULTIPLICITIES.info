Description:
  Hadron multiplicities in hadronic $e^+e^-$ events, taken from Review of
  Particle Properties 2008, table 40.1, page 355.   Average hadron
  multiplicities per hadronic $e^+e^-$ annihilation event at $\sqrt{s}
  \approx {}$ 10, 29--35, 91, and 130--200 GeV. The numbers are averages
  from various experiments. Correlations of the systematic uncertainties
  were considered for the calculation of the averages.
  Beam energy must be specified as analysis option "ENERGY" when rivet-merging samples.
