Description:
'Measurement of the decay asymmetries in $\Lambda^+_c\to\Lambda^0\pi^+$ by the FOCUS experiment.
 The asymmetry parameter is extracted by fitting to normalised angular distribution. N.B. the product of the asymmetry parameters for
 the $\Lambda_c$ and daughter baryon is implemented as this is what is measured, rather than the extracted
 parameter for the $\Lambda_c$ which relies on other measurements of the parameter for the daughter baryon.
 This analysis is useful for testing spin correlations
 in hadron decays.'
