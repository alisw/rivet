Description:
   Inclusive-jet cross sections have been measured in the reaction ep->e+jet+X for photon virtuality Q2 < 1 GeV2 and gamma-p 
   centre-of-mass energies in the region 142 < W(gamma-p) < 293 GeV with the ZEUS detector at HERA using an integrated 
   luminosity of 300 pb-1. Jets were identified using the kT, anti-kT or SIScone jet algorithms in the laboratory frame. 
   Single-differential cross sections are presented as functions of the jet transverse energy, ETjet, and pseudorapidity, 
   etajet, for jets with ETjet > 17 GeV and -1 < etajet < 2.5. In addition, measurements of double-differential inclusive-jet 
   cross sections are presented as functions of ETjet in different regions of etajet. Next-to-leading-order QCD calculations 
   give a good description of the measurements, except for jets with low ETjet and high etajet. The influence of 
   non-perturbative effects not related to hadronisation was studied. Measurements of the ratios of cross sections using 
   different jet algorithms are also presented; the measured ratios are well described by calculations including up to 
   O(alphas2) terms. Values of alphas(Mz) were extracted from the measurements and the energy-scale dependence of the 
   coupling was determined. The value of alphas(Mz) extracted from the measurements based on the kT jet algorithm is 
   alphas(Mz) = 0.1206 +0.0023 -0.0022 (exp.) +0.0042 -0.0035 (th.); the results from the anti-kT and SIScone algorithms 
   are compatible with this value and have a similar precision.
