Description: Charged particle production in deep-inelastic ep scattering is measured with the H1 detector at HERA. The kinematic range of the analysis covers low photon virtualities, 5 < Q2 < 100 GeV2 and small values of Bjorken-x, 10**-2 < x < 10**-2. The analysis is performed in the hadronic centre-of-mass system. The charged particle densities are measured as a function of pseudorapidity eta* and transverse momentum pT* in the range 0 <eta* <5 and 0 < pT* < 10 GeV in bins of x and Q2.
