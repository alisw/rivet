Description:
  H1 diffractive jets from proton--positron collisions at beam energies of
  920~GeV and 27.5~GeV. The cross section of the diffractive process
  e+p -> e+X+p is measured at a centre-of-mass energy of 318 GeV, where the
  system X contains at least two jets and the leading final state proton p is
  detected in the H1 Very Forward Proton Spectrometer. The measurement is
  performed in photoproduction with photon virtualities Q^2 < 2 GeV^2 and in
  deep-inelastic scattering with 4 GeV^2 < Q2 < 80 GeV^2.
