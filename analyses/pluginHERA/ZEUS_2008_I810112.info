Description:
  'The production of $D^{\pm}$ and $D^{0}$ mesons has been measured with the
   ZEUS detector at HERA using an integrated luminosity of $133.6 pb^{-1}$.
   The measurements cover the kinematic range $5 < Q^2 < 1000 GeV^2$, 
   $0.02 < y < 0.7$, $1.5 < p_T^D < 15 GeV$ and $\eta^D < 1.6$. Combinatorial
   background to the D meson signals is reduced by using the ZEUS microvertex detector
   to reconstruct displaced secondary vertices. Production cross sections are compared
   with the predictions of next-to-leading-order QCD which is found to describe the data
   well. Measurements are extrapolated to the full kinematic phase space in order to obtain the open-charm 
  contribution, $F_2^c\bar{c}$, to the proton structure function, $F_2$.'
