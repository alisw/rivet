Description:
  ZEUS analysis for diffractive photoproduction of dijets in proton-positron
  collisions with beam energies of 920~GeV on 27.5~GeV at the ep collider HERA
  using an integrated luminosity of 77.2 pb−1. The measurements were made in the
  kinematic range Q2 < 1 GeV^2, 0.20 < y < 0.85 and xIP < 0.025, where Q2 is the
  photon virtuality, y is the inelasticity and xIP is the fraction of the proton
  momentum taken by the diffractive exchange. The two jets with the highest
  transverse energy, Ejet, were required to satisfy E_jet > 7.5 and 6.5 GeV,
  respectively, and to lie in the pseudorapidity range −1.5 < η_{jet} < 1.5.
