Description:
  'Transverse momentum spectra of charged particles produced in deep inelastic scattering are
   measured as a function of the kinematic variables $x_B$ and $Q^2$ using the H1 detector at
   the ep collider HERA. The data are compared to different parton emission models, either with
   or without ordering of the emissions in transverse momentum. The data provide evidence for a
    relatively large amount of parton radiation between the current and the remnant systems.'
