Description:
  'Jet cross sections were measured in charged current deep inelastic $e^{\pm}p$
  scattering at high boson virtualities $Q^2$ with the ZEUS detector at HERA II 
  using an integrated luminosity of $0.36 fb^{-1}$. Differential cross sections are 
  presented for inclusive-jet production as functions of $Q^2$, Bjorken x and the jet 
  transverse energy and pseudorapidity. The dijet invariant mass cross section is also
   presented. Observation of three- and four-jet events in charged-current $e^{\pm}p$ processes 
   is reported for the first time. The predictions of next-to-leading-order (NLO) QCD 
   calculations are compared to the measurements. The measured inclusive-jet cross sections 
   are well described in shape and normalization by the NLO predictions. The data have the 
   potential to constrain the u and d valence quark distributions in the proton if included 
   as input to global fits.'
