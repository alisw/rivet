Description:
  'The inclusive production of $D^{*\pm}$ (2010)  mesons in deep-inelastic scattering is studied with the H1 detector at HERA. In the kinematic region $1 < Q^2 < 100 $ GeV$^2$ and $0.05 < y < 0.7$ in $e^+ p$ cross section for inclusive $D^{*\pm}$ meson production is measured in the visible range $p_{T}^{D*} > 1.5$ GeV and $|\eta^{D*}| < 1.5 $.'
ValidationInfo:
  'A description of the process used to validate the Rivet code against
  the original experimental analysis. Cut-flow tables and similar information
  are welcome'
