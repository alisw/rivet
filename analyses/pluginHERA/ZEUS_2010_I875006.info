Description:
  'Single- and double-differential inclusive dijet cross sections in neutral 
current deep inelastic ep scattering have been measured with the ZEUS detector
using an integrated luminosity of 374 pb$^{-1}$. The measurement was performed
at large values of the photon virtuality, Q$^2$, between 125 and 20000 GeV$^2$. 
The jets were reconstructed with the k$_T$ cluster algorithm in the Breit
reference frame and selected by requiring their transverse energies in the 
Breit frame, E$_T^{B,jet}$, to be larger than 8 GeV. In addition, the invariant 
mass of the dijet system, M$_{jj}$, was required to be greater than 20 GeV. The
cross sections are described by the predictions of next-to-leading-order QCD.'
