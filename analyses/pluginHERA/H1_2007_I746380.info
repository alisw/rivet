Description:
  H1 diffractive jets from proton--positron collisions at beam energies of
  820~GeV and 27.5~GeV. Measurements are presented of differential dijet cross
  sections in diffractive photoproduction (Q2 < 0.01 GeV2) and deep-inelastic
  scattering processes (DIS, 4 < Q2 < 80 GeV2). The event topology is given by
  ep â†’ eXY , in which the system X, containing at least two jets, is separated
  from a leading low-mass proton remnant system Y by a large rapidity gap.
