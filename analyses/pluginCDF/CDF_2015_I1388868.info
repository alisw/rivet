Description:
  'We study charged particle production in proton--antiproton collisions at 300 GeV,
  900 GeV, and 1.96 TeV. We use the direction of the charged particle with the largest
  transverse momentum in each event to define three regions of $\eta$--$\phi$ space;
  toward, away, and transverse. The average number and the average scalar pT sum of
  charged particles in the transverse region are sensitive to the modeling of the
  underlying event. The transverse region is divided into a MAX and MIN transverse
  region, which helps separate the hard component (initial and final-state radiation)
  from the beam-beam remnant and multiple parton interaction components of the scattering.'
