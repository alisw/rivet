Description:
  'Measurement of $R$  and the hadronic cross section for energies between 2.4 and 6.9 GeV.
   The charged hadron spectum at 3, 4.8 and 7.4 GeV is also measured.
   The muonic cross sections is also outputted to the yoda file
   so that ratio $R$ can be recalcuated if runs are combined.'
