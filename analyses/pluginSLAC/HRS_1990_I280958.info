Description:
  $K^0$ meson momentum spectrum measured at $\sqrt{s} = 29.$ GeV using the HRS detector at
  PEP. The analysis includes flavour tagging by requiring either a single charged particle with $x_p>0.65 (light quarks) or a $D^{*+}$ meson (charm).
  The rapidities with respect to the chartged thrust axis are also included.
  The bin widths are not included in either the paper or HEPdata and have therefore been infered.
