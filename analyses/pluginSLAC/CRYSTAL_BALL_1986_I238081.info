Description:
  'Measurement of $R$ in $e^+e^-$ collisions by the Crystal Ball experiment for energies between 3.67 and 4.5 GeV.
   The cross section for $D^*$ production is also measured.
   The individual hadronic and muonic cross sections are also outputted to the yoda file
   so that ratio $R$ can be recalcuated if runs are combined.'
