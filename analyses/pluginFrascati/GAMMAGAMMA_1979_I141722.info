Description:
  'Measurement of $R$ in $e^+e^-$ collisions by Gamma-Gamma-2 for energies between 1.42 and 3.09 GeV.
   The average charged and neutral particle multiplicity is also measured.
   The individual hadronic and muonic cross sections are also outputted to the yoda file
   so that ratio $R$ can be recalcuated if runs are combined.'
