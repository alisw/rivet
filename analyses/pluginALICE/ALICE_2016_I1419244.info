Description: 
  'Anisotropic flow of charged particles in PbPb collisions at 5.02 TeV.
  The analysis calculates flow coefficients using Generic Framework, integrated
  and differential in pT, as function of centrality.
  Only results for 5.02 TeV are calculated in the analysis, even though the HepData
  record also includes results for 2.76 TeV. Those results should be validated through
  a separate analysis referring to the primary citation. For this reason also ratios
  between flow coefficients at two energies are excluded.'
