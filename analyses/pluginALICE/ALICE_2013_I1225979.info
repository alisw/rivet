RunInfo: PbPb minimum bias events. The analysis holds the Primary Particle definition, so don't limit decays on generator level.

Description:
  'Charged particle pseudorapidity density in centrality classes 0-5,5-10,10-20,20-30. Measurements cover a wide $\eta$ range from -3.5 to 5. Centrality classes refer to forward V0 spectrum, as also measured by ALICE, can be modified to use a user definition instead.'
