RunInfo: PbPb minimum bias events. The analysis holds the Primary Particle definition, so don't limit decays on generator level. 
NeedCrossSection: no
Beams: [1000822080, 1000822080]
# This is _total_ energy of beams, so this becomes 208*2760=574080

Description:
  'Charged particle pseudorapidity density in centrality classes 30-40, 40-50, 50-60, 60-70, 70-80, 80-90. Measurements cover a wide $\eta$ range from -3.5 to 5. Centrality classes refer to forward V0 spectrum, as also measured by ALICE, can be modified to use a user definition instead.'

ToDo:
 - Implement the analysis, test it, remove this ToDo, and mark as VALIDATED :-)
