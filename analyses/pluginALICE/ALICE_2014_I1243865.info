Description:
  Measurements of transverse momentum (pT) spectra for charged Xi and Omega hyperon 
  production at mid-rapidity in several centrality intervals for Pb-Pb collisions 
  at sqrt(sNN) = 2.76 TeV recorded in 2010. Mid-rapidity yields, integrated over 
  pT, have also been determined, together with the enhancements with respect to pp 
  collisions and the hyperon-to-pion production ratios
