RunInfo: PbPb minimum bias events. The analysis holds the Primary Particle definition, so don't limit decays on generator level. 
NeedCrossSection: no
Options:
 - cent=REF,GEN,IMP,USR
Beams: [1000822080, 1000822080]
# This is _total_ energy of beams, so this becomes 208*5023=1044784
Energies: [1044784]
Description:
  'Charged particle pseudorapidity density in centrality classes. Measurements cover a wide $\eta$ range from -3.5 to 5. Centrality classes refer to forward V0 spectrum, as also measured by ALICE, can be modified to use a user definition instead.'
