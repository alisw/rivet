Description:
  'Angular correlations between like-sign and opposite-sign identified particles,
   integrated over $\Delta \eta < 1.3$. The analysis makes use of event mixing
   to remove background. The current implementation of the event micing is not 
   validated by experiment, and should be used with caution. Note in particular
   that for the event mixing to behave sensibly, event weights are assumed to be
   unity. Do not run this analysis with weighted events'
