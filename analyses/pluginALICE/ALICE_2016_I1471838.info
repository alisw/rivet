Description:
  'Measurements of pT spectra and yields of (multi)strange hadrons, as well as 
   protons and pions (yields only) in forward multiplicity classes at 7 TeV.
   Ratios of yields to pion yields are constructed. The analysis takes care
   of particle reconstruction as the experiment does, so no finite lifetime
   should be imposed on generator level. Experimental results are scaled to
   inelastic cross section, and generator setup should be adjusted accordingly.'
Keywords: [QCD, Minimum bias, collectivity, small systems]
