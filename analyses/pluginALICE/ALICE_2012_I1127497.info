Description:
  'The inclusive transverse momentum ($p_T$) distributions of primary charged particles are measured in the pseudo-rapidity range $|\eta| < 0.8$ as a function of event centrality in Pb--Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{nn}} = 2.76$ TeV with ALICE at the LHC. The data are presented in the $p_T$ range $0.15<p_T<50$ GeV/c for nine centrality intervals from 70-80% to 0-5%. The Pb-Pb spectra are presented in terms of the nuclear modification factor RAA using a pp reference spectrum measured at the same collision energy. We observe that the suppression of high-pT particles strongly depends on event centrality. In central collisions (0-5%) the yield is most suppressed with $R_{AA} \approx 0.13$ at $p_T= 6-7$ GeV/c. Above $p_T = 7$ GeV/c, there is a significant rise in the nuclear modification factor, which reaches $R_{AA} \approx 0.4$ for $p_T > 30$ GeV/c. In peripheral collisions (70-80%), the suppression is weaker with $R_{AA} \approx 0.7$ almost independently of $p_T$. The measured nuclear modification factors are compared to other measurements and model calculations.'
