Description:
  'The yield of charged particles associated with high-pT trigger particles ($8 < p_{\perp} < 15$ GeV/c) is measured with the ALICE detector in Pb-Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}} = 2.76$ TeV relative to proton-proton collisions at the same energy. The conditional per-trigger yields are extracted from the narrow jet-like correlation peaks in azimuthal di-hadron correlations. In the 5\% most central collisions, we observe that the yield of associated charged particles with transverse momenta $p_\perp > 3$ GeV/c on the away-side drops to about 60\% of that observed in pp collisions, while on the near-side a moderate enhancement of 20-30\% is found.'
