Description:
  "The $p_\\text{T}$-differential inclusive production cross sections of the prompt charmed mesons $D^0$, $D^+$, 
  and $D^{\\ast +}$ in the rapidity range $|y|<0.5$ were measured in proton-proton collisions at $\\sqrt{s}=7$ TeV 
  at the LHC using the ALICE detector. Reconstructing the decays $D^0 \\to K^-\\pi^+$, $D^+\\to K^-\\pi^+\\pi^+$,
  $D^{\\ast +} \\to D^0\\pi^+$, and their charge conjugates, about 8,400 $D^0$, 2,900 $D^+$, and 2,600 $D^{\\ast +}$ 
  mesons with $1 < p_\\text{T} < 24$ GeV/$c$ were counted, after selection cuts, in a data sample of 3.14$\\times 10^8$ 
  events collected with a minimum-bias trigger (integrated luminosity $L_\\text{int} = 5$/nb). 
  The results are described within uncertainties by predictions based on perturbative QCD."
